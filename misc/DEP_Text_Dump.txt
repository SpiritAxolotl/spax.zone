{Y} ..? What are these..? **Found missing journal pages**
{Y} ..? More pages..? **Found missing journal pages**
{Y} ..? Are these the last ones..? **Found missing journal pages**
{A} Oh! Yoki!!! You came to visit me!!! What a surprise!! Hello Hello! {Y} Aimottle... Hello. / I see you’re in the middle of repairs right now. {A} Yea! I’ve been at it all day! {Y} Did you damage your arm? What happened? {A} I got into a fight with a BEAST-Type earlier... I’m not really sure what I did to upset her. I don’t think I did anything unusual... I was just minding my own business. Next thing I knew... She charged right at me and tore through my arm. My mechanical arm got damaged a bit but... It’s nothing the best mechanic in the whole kingdom can’t fix! / {Y} It’s a shame Claire’s potions don’t work on you... Otherwise, I’d go and grab one for you. / {A} Ugh! Even if they did work on me, there’s no way I’d take it! Knowing her, she’d throw in poison just to spite me! {Y} I don’t think she’d go that far... (Well... Maybe she would.) {A} I bet she would! I bet it was her that agitated the BEAST-Type to attack me! Next time I see her, I’ll give her a piece of my mind! {Y} I really don’t think she upset the BEAST-Type... If anyone agitated the BEAST-Type, don’t you think it’d be Zera? / {A} Oh.. I guess so... I guess I’ve been seeing him around more lately... Huh... {Y} Maybe you should give him a piece of your mind instead. {A} No way. Zera’s really scary.. {Y} Tell me about it... (..What happened to all that energy from earlier?)
{A} Do you really think Zera would’ve agitated that BEAST-Type? {Y} If it was anyone, it’d be him, right? {A} Maybe... But why would he do that? He only ever focuses on you... {Y} I guess you’re right. {A} So if it wasn’t Zera..! It was definitely Claire!! {Y} You’re just looking for a reason to blame Claire, huh. (I wonder if it really was Zera..?) (BEAST-Types have been unusually active lately...)
{A} Last time we had a run-in with a BEAST-Type, Claire said “This is so annoying, you can handle this, right?” And without waiting for me to answer, she just flew off! She left me to fend off the BEAST-Type all by myself!! I barely made it out of that scrap alive! She’s the worst!!! {Y} Now THAT does sound like her...
{Y} The lamp is on. I guess even though it’s sunny out, there’s no windows down here...
{Y} Boxes of what looks like spare parts. I guess her mechanical arm needs lots of maintenance.
{Y} Aren’t these vegetables from my garden..?
{Y} Seems to be a manual for various machinery... Did she write this herself?
{Y} Aimottle’s bed. The bed is hard as a rock... Also there’s a charging cable attached to it.
{Y} A photo of me, Claire and Aimottle. ..But there’s scribbles drawn over Claire’s face.
{Y} ...
{R} ... / So did you have fun following us on our quest? {Y} W..What do you mean? {R} I’m a little sharper than the others. Don’t worry, I know you don’t work for the Dark Lord. Though, your presence reeks of something dark... What are you exactly? {Y} ... {R} ...Well I won’t pry. I’m sure you have your own path to follow. {Y} (...I wonder if I do?
{R} Hope we won’t have to cross blades one day.
{Y} ................ Really? That’s all? At least leave the room next time...
{W} I smell it! I smell it! I smell that scent!!! / She was here recently! Yoki was here! / I’ll find!! And..Eat.
{W} Zera! {Z} ...
{A} Ah... It’s you... {W} !!! It’s the tasty-looking rabbit!!! {A} You’re not gonna attack me, are you? I finally finished repairing my arm... Don’t make me do it again! {W} I smell a familiar scent!!! / It’s Yoki! You were with Yoki earlier! {A} I was... Yeah... You better not think of going after her again! She has enough to deal with! {W} Enough talk!!! I’ll eat you too!!! {A} We’ll see about that! / {W} !!!! {A} ............................... / Well... I’m sure she’ll be ok... I should run off before she regains consciousness. / {W} Huh? Huh? Where’d rabbit go? I’ll go find her!!! She won’t get away from me that easily!!!
{W} ? What’s that smell..? / It smells familiar!! / It’s coming from... Here! / This paper! / What’s on here..? ... This... / This is.. / This is from.... / {-} ...mom..?
{W} Tasty bat! {-} screech!
{W} Trusty spear!
{W} Tasty bones!
{W} My glasses! I don’t need it anymore. My nose is my sight!
{W} Friend!
{W} Comfy bed!
{T} Wow!! Welcome to the bonus room! You went through a lot of reading just to get here, huh? Well I hope you’re ready for more of it!!!!! You must be thinking: “Who is this?” I’m Tem of course! (Or temmie) The creator of this game! I hope you liked it!! I know you don’t really do much except walk around and make images appear.. But! I learned how variables work! So there’s cool random stuff sometimes. I worked really hard on drawing all the art and writing things!!! I even tried my hand at the music!! But it was too hard.. So! I made toby and camellia do it instead!! Isn’t the music amazing? Better than the game itself if I do say so myself! Well, anyway, [Insert Player Name here], what can I do for you? {-} [Favorite color?/What’s next?/Lonely Girl?/BEAST-Type?/Music?/Get outta here] # [Favorite color] {T} Orange!! # [What’s next?] {T} A good question! / I’m not sure yet. / I’ve been thinking I wanna try doing a comic! So maybe a small little comic thing? Then maybe another game..? I also wanna do another animated video at some point!! I’m eager to continue this story in many different mediums!! I just haven’t figured out which ones yet.. # [Lonely Girl?] {T} Well, if you wanna see..! # [BEAST-Type?] {T} Yea! Cool name right? Totally doesn’t sound like a temporary name at all. ... Sorry.. I’m not very good at thinking up names.. But it’s ok! BEAST-Types are just THIS world’s naming convention for them. It’s not like other worlds all use the same names for each creature or concept. I’ll have more chances to think of a better name for them. [Other worlds?] ## [Other worlds?] Other worlds! Yea! You’ll see one day! I hope.. # [Music?] {T} Isn’t it amazing!? Isn’t it WAY too good to be in a silly little game like this!? Seriously!! Camellia and Toby are really incredible, huh? A few of the arrangements are actually from some melodies I made originally.. My original songs were really rough.. I’m still a novice at music-making.. When I listened to the arrangements Camellia made of them, I actually teared up! To hear such a cool arrangement of a song that I made myself.. It was a really inspiring feeling!! It makes me want to make more music!! # [Get outta here] {T} Ok.
{T} What else can I do for you? {-} [Favorite color?/What’s next?/Lonely Girl?/BEAST-Type?/Music?/Get outta here] # [Favorite color] {T} Orange!! # [What’s next?] {T} A good question! / I’m not sure yet. / I’ve been thinking I wanna try doing a comic!

{-} *********BEAST-Types*********** A Theory on Their Origin It is believed that BEAST-Types are those who have arrived from another world, but are incompatible with the world they’ve entered. This creates an instability in their form while retaining varying levels of their previous identity. They constantly stabilize and destabilize their appearance based on their emotions. {T} Oh I forgot to return that to the library. I’ll put it back one of these days. I can’t read it anyway. The words are too difficult for me to understand

{-} A soft comfy bed. {T} I tend to sleep at the bottom corner of the bed. I don’t know why, but I find it very comforting. It’s also imperative that my pillow is flat, or my neck hurts in the morning. Just thought you’d like to know that little tidbit about me
{-} A soft comfy bed.
{-} A collection of Tem’s favorite manga. There’s so many... {T} I like to buy the physicals and support the artists
{-} A collection of Tem’s favorite manga. There’s so many...
{-} Tem’s laptop... It’s very slow and has food stains all over it. {T} My keyboard is a second plate
{-} Tem’s laptop... It’s very slow and has food stains all over it.
{-} Tem’s computer... It’s very fancy and has a large monitor. There’s also food stains all over it.
{-} Tem’s box.
{-} Return to the title screen? [Yes/No]
{-} Hop! Hop! Have you thought about playing the game avoiding Zera? That guy is more sensitive than you might think!
{-} What a lovely painting.
{Y} Hello... Anyone here? {-} Hey! Is that Yoki I hear? / {Ca} Sorry! I was handling some stuff in the back. How are ya! {Y} I’m alright, I’m just taking a small walk. {Ca} Oh? You don’t look so great to me. {Y} Well... Actually I guess I’ve been better. {Ca} Thought so. Can’t fool these sharp eyes! tell me, what’s been on your mind? {Y} It’s a little tough to explain... Let’s just say I haven’t been getting much sleep these days. {Ca} Hmm... I see. Well! How about I get you some nice hot tea! My treat! Looks like you could use it! {Y} Thanks Caina, that sounds great. / {Ca} So... Besides bad sleep, what else’s been goin’ on in your life? / {Y} Work’s been busy. BEAST-Types have been very active lately. Feels like the Prince has a new job for me every other day. {Ca} Oh I see... Man... I remember the days I used to work for the Crown. / Those were some rough times. I’m glad to leave it all behind me. {Y} Yeah... I can’t imagine what it must’ve been like to work as a mercenary. {Ca} You get your hands tied up in some pretty messy situations. / How about you though? You handle situations with BEAST-Types, right? Can’t imagine that work being too pleasant either. {Y} It’s not so bad. Calming them down when they’re on a rampage isn’t too hard for me. The Prince can get pretty upset if I let them free afterwards though... / {Ca} Hah! How just like you! / You’re the only one I know who’d be so cool in dealing with BEAST-Types. I’m sure anyone else would take being a mercenary over the work you deal with. Though I guess you’ve got that odd power that seems to knock them right out. {Y} Yeah though... I don’t like relying on that power so much. I’d rather deal with them without using this power that I don’t understand. {Ca} Yeah, I get you... / Well! Speaking of which... I’ve been feeling pretty stiff lately, And business is a bit slow at the moment... Wanna head to the forest and spar for bit? I’m rarin’ to stretch my arms and legs a bit. {Y} Sure thing. How about we meet up at our old sparring spot? {Ca} That old tree stump? Sounds good! I’ll meet ya there.
{Ca} That little workout we had earlier was great! Let’s do it again soon!
{Y} A jar of mints. For people who’ve finished their meals and have paid.
{Y} Statues of the former king and queen. ...The Prince’s parents. It’s too bad I never got to meet them myself. The people really seem to admire and respect them... ... The Prince feels like he has to live up to his parents’ reputation. Not only does he not want to let his people down. He doesn’t want to let down the hopes and expectations his parents had for him. Must be hard for him
{Y} The Prince’s parents were killed by BEAST-Types when he was still pretty young. He holds a grudge against BEAST-Types and is stern in matters regarding them. Though... I think he’s lightened up a bit since I came into the picture. ..I’m sure It’ll still be awhile before his heart recovers
{Y} Technically, the Prince is the “King” now... But for as long as I’ve known him, the people refer to him as the “Prince”. I think he himself also prefers to be called a “Prince”.
{-} I still miss the Queen dearly
{-} I’ll take care of her son to the best of my ability.
{-} I looked up to the previous King a lot. I still mourn his death. I try to hold out hope or the Prince, but I don’t know if he’ll ever quite be his father
{-} I wonder if anyone could ever live up to the previous King’s legacy.
{-} The Prince hasn’t been eating much these days. He seems preoccupied with all the reports of BEAST-Type attacks lately
{-} I’m worried for the Prince’s health.
{-} The Prince works very hard, but his cold personality puts off a lot of people. A lot of his subjects and soldiers have some pretty unkind things to say about him
{-} I don’t have the heart to tell the Prince about any of this...
{-} I remember the days we kept you in here. We all thought you were a BEAST-Type. We were so confused as to why you were so civil and didn’t resist. I guess that’s why the Prince gave you a chance and let you work for the Crown.
{Y} ... I remember spending time in here...
{-} Soldier A: Ah. You’re new here so you don’t know about Yoki... There was a BEAST-Type that got into the nearby Village and really wrecked the place a few years ago. A few soldiers were sent over there to get rid of it. But... When they arrived, they witnessed her take it down, ALL by herself! It was unlike anything anybody had ever seen... She displayed both incredible strength and magic. People were speculating she was either a BEAST-Type or a Witch... Or maybe even both. / Soldier B: Wow!! How creepy!! Did they ever find out what she was? / Soldier A: No... Nobody was able to figure it out. Not even she knew apparently. One thing’s for sure, If she didn’t come in so peacefully, she’d have been executed by now for sure. / Soldier B: I wonder if anyone here is even capable of executing her.. Seems like she’d overpower anyone. It’s a good thing she ended up being on our side! / Soldier A: Eh! I don’t trust her one bit. There’s no way someone like that comes out of nowhere and ends up being any good. If the Prince had any spine, he’d have taken her out himself when she got taken in. {Y} (...
{-} Soldier A: I think it’s only a matter of time until that woman shows her true colors. In my opinion we should get rid of her before it’s too late. {Y} (...)
{Y} The door is locked.
{-} Halt! ... Oh... Wait... It’s just you
{-} I don’t think I could even really stop you if you went somewhere you weren’t supposed to.
{-} Downstairs is the dining hall. It’ll be quite some time before a meal is ready however.
{-} Welcome back, Yoki. The Prince is up in his office if you need him.
{-} The Courtyard is up ahead.
{Y} A large fountain. The bird on top is really cute.
{-} My dad doesn’t like the Prince. He says he’ll never be like the last King
{-} My dad says a BEAST-Type works for the Crown. Is that true? {Y} (...)
{-} Chirp..
{-} The Prince is so handsome..! If only he wasn’t so cold and stern.
{-} Hey there. Got more work to do for the Prince today? {Y} No... Just taking a small walk.
{-} Oh... Welcome back Yoki.
{-} We’re currently preparing the Prince’s favorite meal, Stuffed peppers, with some baked clams as an appetizer
{-} He’s been working hard lately, so he deserves a fine meal to keep his spirits up.
{Y} There’s several utensils in here ready to be cleaned.
{Y} All the food being prepared looks so tasty. I want some...
{Y} I guess they’re preparing some fish..?
{Y} The garbage must be emptied regularly.
{Y} Such a fancy fridge.
{-} Onions, mushrooms, chopped up garlic cloves, ground beef, and tomatoes, Seasoned with some salt, pepper, and thyme... All cooked and stuffed into a pepper, and placed into the oven... A wonderful recipe for success!
{Y} I wonder what kind of meal is being prepared...
{-} The food isn’t ready yet. You can’t rush perfection.
{Y} A stack of plates.
{Y} So many different foods being prepared at once. Guess they do have to feed an entire castle...
{P} What do you want? {Y} (Cold as ever...) {P} I’m quite busy right now, so out with it, quickly. {Y} I just came to stop by. I had a bad dream, and... {P} Bad dream? Don’t tell me you came here just for idle chatter. {Y} ..I guess I came here for something like that. {P} Honestly. What do you want me to do, console you? Read you a little bed-time story? Fetch you a warm glass of milk? / {Y} (This guy...) / You know.. You’d be more popular with your subjects if you were a little more considerate. {P} Hmph My people like me juts fine, I’ll have you know! {Y} That’s not what I’ve been hearing. / {P} Enough of this. If you’re finished, I’d like to get back to work. {Y} Alright... Guess I’ll come by again later
{P}
{P} By the way... I’ve been hearing about a witch who’s been enchanting the forest. You don’t happen to be harboring this witch..? Actually, you don’t need to answer that. I can tell by the look on your face. {Y} (Guess he finally found out...) {P} I’m sure you’re aware the practice of Witchcraft is a high crime. ...I’ll turn my head the other way for now. Think of it as a thank-you for your assistance to the kingdom. However, should we see this witch outside of your residence, I’m afraid we’ll have to apprehend them. {Y} Understood... ... You sure do feel like talking to me a lot all of a sudden. I guess you’re actually feeling pretty lonely, huh? {P} ...Excuse me? / Just shut up and leave already. {Y} (You’re so easy to read, Prince.
{Y} (Actually... I’ve disobeyed him so many times.) (Even when he finds out, he always lets me off the hook.) (Deep down, he’s really very lonely and quite the softy.) (It feels like.. He only acts this way because he has to...
{Y} (I feel like he might get along with Claire.) (I should introduce them sometime.)
{P} Please do not mess with my paperwork. {Y} ...
{-} Oh! This is always fun to watch. I love seeing you and the Prince go at it
{-} It’s fun to watch you guys banter. He’s pretty stern and harsh with anyone else. Except maybe the High Knight.
{-} The Prince is very concentrated on his work right now. Please do not disturb him.
{P} By the way... / This paperwork I’m currently filling out is for you. Which means, I have a job for you to do soon. {Y} Oh? {P} A few of my soldiers have disappeared up north. We think it might be due to an aggressive BEAST-Type in the area. {Y} ..And you want me to go and do something about it. {P} Precisely. Once I have a little more information, I’ll be sending someone to pick you up at the Village. It’ll still be a few days until we’re ready to send you out, So there’s no need to get ready just yet. When that time does come, you’re to assist my men in scouting the area. If we determine the cause to be a BEAST-Type, you are to exterminate it at once. {Y} ..Alright. Just so you know... If it turns out to be a human behind this... I won’t be helping with this. {P} Of course. I’ll uphold our agreement. And you must understand... You can only live peacefully in your little forest house if you follow my orders. Do not show mercy to these dangerous BEAST-Types. Should you do so, and disobey my orders to eliminate it... I’ll be re-determining your own threat level to our kingdom. {Y} Yea yea... I get it.
{Y} Seems like some kind of index or record. ... Oh? There’s a section for me in here. {-} *************Yoki************* Dangerous suspicious character, potential BEAST-Type. Demeanor: calm, passive, avoids conflict. Prince’s notes: High risk due to inability to determine species and threat level. Unknown being capable of great strength and use of magic of questionable origin. Source of magic is unlikely Witchcraft. Keep under surveillance at all times. SIGNED AGREEMENT: Free travel and residence in Castle Town and nearby Village in return for Services to the Crown. Will not enter missions where the target is human. (Origin-Type or Natural-Type.) Refusal or breach of signed agreement is grounds for elimination or detainment. {Y} Guess the Prince really makes sure to document everything. Wonder how often this is updated

{Y} What an unnecessarily large and fancy bed. It is very comfy though... ..The Prince would throw a fit if he saw me sleeping on it.
{Y} A beautiful view of the Courtyard.
{Y} Such a large collection of clothes. It’s all so fancy too... I guess he does rule a kingdom... So this shouldn’t be that surprising.
{Y} Such a fancy dresser. The mirror on it is so clear and crisp.
{-} Ah... It’s you. Sorry, I’m afraid I don’t trust you at all. You may have the Prince and the High Knight fooled, but not me. {Y} (...
{-} I have my eye on you.
{-} zzz.... / High Knight: HEY. WAKE UP. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING? SLEEPING ON THE JOB? / Sleeping soldier: N-NO MA’AM... OF COURSE NOT..! {Y} (...
{-} The High Knight sure can be scary. I think the fear will keep me awake for the rest of the day... Maybe all night.
{-} The Prince should be back soon. The High Knight is currently dealing with matters here in the Prince’s stead
{-} The High Knight is nothing to sneeze at. Her loyalty to the Crown and competence in battle inspires all of us.
{-} The Prince isn’t even here right now. Wish I could step out for a bit
{-} I’d have stepped out by now... If it wasn’t the High Knight on Watch here right now. She’s more commanding and stern than the Prince.
{-} Ah! Yoki... S-sorry, I-I’m nnnot s-scared
{-} Y-you’re not really a BEAST-Type, a-are you? {Y} No... I’m pretty sure I’m not. (How do so many guards still think this.)
{-} When the King and Queen passed away, The High Knight consoled the Prince and helped give him the confidence to ascend the throne. I think in some ways, the High Knight is the Prince’s confidence
{-} That being said, even the High Knight still refers to him as “Prince”.
{-} The High Knight grew up alongside the Prince, so they both trust each other greatly. She’s worked hard all her life and it shows in her skill and diligence
{-} When the Prince is busy with work, he always trusts the High Knight to fill in for his other duties.
{-} The Prince is in his office at the moment. I think he’s been meaning to see you anyway, so you should head up there
{-} The Prince is in his office at the moment. I think he’s been meaning to see you anyway, so you should head up there. {Y} Oh, I did already. Thank you for telling me though
{-} Regardless of what the other knights say, I think you’re alright. If the Prince has his faith in you, then so do I.
{Y} The throne. I wanna sit on it. / {-} High Knight: Don’t you even think about it. {Y} I won’t really... Don’t worry.
{Y} These windows are so big.
{-} Eh? Yoki? What are ye doin’ here? Ye ain’t any good with a blade. {Y} Just dropping by... I like to look at your works even if I can’t use them. They all look so impressive. {-} Eh! Look all ye want. Just know none o’ them are fer ye
{Y} (I used to come here with Caina when she still worked at the Castle.) (The Blacksmith here works for the Crown, so everything is high quality.) (Though I think he doesn’t like me so much because I never buy anything...)
{Y} Various tools of the trade.
{Y} What a fantastic sword. Kind of makes me wish I knew how to use them... I feel like I’d look cool with a sword.
{Y} A container filled with water.
{Y} An anvil... I guess the weapon is hammered on here..?
{Y} A furnace. As expected... It’s very hot.
{-} Good day, is there anything I can do for you? {Y} No, I’m ok
{-} Good day, is there anything I can do for you? {Y} Hi... Uh... Claire wanted to pick up an order from you... {-} ... Ahh... I see, one moment. / Thanks you for waiting. Here’s her order. {Y} Thank you... {-} I trust if you know Claire, you’ll know to keep this a secret, yes? {Y} You mean... that you sell these items..? {Y} Yeah... No worries. (This situation is a little...
{-} I trust you won’t tell anyone.
{-} Town Doctor
{-} If you ask me, I think the reason so many BEAST-Types have been showing up, Is because of the one the Prince hired! {Y} (...
{-} Honestly! What was he thinking by having a BEAST-Type work for him..? Even after his parents were killed by one!
{-} Man I’ve had enough of this town. I’ve been thinking about moving to the Village nearby.
{-} I want a quieter life...
{-} Town Blacksmith
{-} I was thinking of picking up a new spear from the Blacksmith. His work is really fantastic!
{-} Soldier A: There was apparently some casualties up north. People are thinking it was another BEAST-Type that went rampant and killed some soldiers. / Soldier B: That means they’re probably gonna send Yoki up there to check it out, huh? / Soldier A: Yeah probably. If anyone’s gonna get tangled up in that, better her than us, right?
{-} Meooooooww
{-} Meow!
{-} Rrrrr
{-} Meooooooww
{-} Grrr
{-} Castle Town gate
{Y} ..? How did... My journal end up here? (Should I record stuff?) [Yes/No]
{-} Headin’ over to the village? // Want a lift? // {Y} [Sure/Not right now] /// [Not right now] I’m alright for now. /// [Sure] Yes, thank you. // {-} Alright. Hop on in. * {-} Enjoyin’ the carriage ride, eh? // {Y} ... // {-} Another? // {Y} [Sure/Not right now] /// [Not right now] I’m alright for now. /// [Sure] Yes, thank you. // {-} Alright. Hop on in
{-} Take care.
{-} Ugh. What a boring day. Wish something interesting would happen. Hey, why don’t you transform into a large BEAST-Type so I have somethin’ to cut down? {Y} Sorry... I don’t think I can do that
{-} I don’t know why the Prince trusts you so much. When you go berserk one day, I wanna be the one to chop you down. Maybe they’d call me a Hero, heh. Things would definitely be less boring, don’t you think? {Y} (...)
{-} I’m so tired... I hope someone comes and takes over my shift soon.
{-} Welcome! There’s a room available if you’d like! You look quite tired. {Y} I’ll be ok..! Thank you though
{-} Welcome– Oh! I’m sorry. All the rooms are taken! {Y} No worries! (I feel kind of relieved at who reserved the rooms...)
{Y} The lamp is on even though it’s so bright out.
{CO} We... May have been defeated by the Dark Lord.. But, this isn’t over! We’ll overcome any trial, we’ll save the world! {Y} (..I’m glad Zera ended up going easy on them after all.)
{Y} Empty... I guess these wardrobes are for guests after all.
{Y} This bed is very comfy.
{Y} The lamp is on even though it’s so bright out.
{C} ... / There is... A foul power that resides within you. Are you with the Dark Lord? Come to taunt us in our defeat..? {Y} No... Nothing like that. I don’t like him very much either– / {C} The gods despise you. They will never allow something like you to harm our world. In their name, we will rid the world of your presence. {Y} (I should leave her be.) (She’s probably still shaken by her confrontation with Zera...)
{K} We may have lost our battle with the Dark Lord... But, somehow we’ve managed to live another day. It’s not over yet! We’ll keep on fighting until the end! With my friends by my side, we can overcome anything! {Y} (I’m happy for his optimism.)
{-} Welcome to the Library. I believe you have a few overdue books... Please bring them back soon before I issue you a late fee. {Y} Sorry... I’ll bring them back soon. (A lot of the books I borrowed are for Claire.) (I hope she’s almost done, I don’t want a late fee.
{-} I’m happy you enjoy reading... But please bring your books back soon for others who may want to read the same books.
{-} *******Blessing of Magic******** A Delicate Balance Some people are born with the blessing of magic. The amount of magic that someone can be born with varies from person to person. From a young age, Those with magic can be specially trained by the Crown in their choice of study. But with a great gift comes great responsibility. Those with magic are expected to follow strict laws set by the Crown. Misuse of magic, such as the practice of Witchcraft or other forbidden practices, Are subject to strict punishment, such as detainment and execution.
{-} ********Misuse of Magic******** Witchcraft While magic is a subject with endless possibilities to create and perform the impossible, There are fields of magic that are dangerously unpredictable and cannot be fully fathomed. To avoid severe consequences and danger to the general populace, such crafts are forbidden. Witchcraft is a highly forbidden practice. It dives into realms beyond mortal comprehension, With high consequences and risk to every spell or ritual performed, even the fully perfected ones. Before its ban, there were many who saw its endless possibilities and attempted its studies. However, the results of people’s endeavors were catastrophic and have caused countless deaths. As the risk outweighed its promise, many kingdoms have deemed it too dangerous to pursue its study.
{-} ****Origin and Natural-Types**** Part 1 The 3 major classifications are: 1) Origin-Types, 2) Natural-Types, 3) BEAST-Types. Natural-Types develop and share physical traits dependent on their environment. They typically share features with nearby wildlife. However, some have been found to rarely adapt plant-like features. Origin-Types on the other hand, are those who do not adapt physical traits regardless of their environment. Natural-Types and Origin-Types are classified as “human”. BEAST-Types are not.
{-} ****Origin and Natural-Types**** Part 2 After the appearance of BEAST-Types, Natural-Types began to face prejudice. Since both BEAST-Types and Natural-Types can share features with wildlife, Origin-Types are sometimes defensive and aggressive to Natural-Types. This has caused division within communities, And some have chosen to live separate from each other as a result.
{-} *********BEAST-Types*********** Unknown Type Part 1 BEAST-Types, unlike Origin-Types and Natural-Types, are not defined as “human”. Each BEAST-Type is considered their own species, unrelated to each other. And thus have the overarching classification of “BEAST-Type”. It is unknown where they come from, and have been known to simply just “appear”. They have a wide-ranging degree of intelligence and mannerisms. Most have been known to have the demeanor of wild animals and are typically very violent, But there have been documented cases of human-like behavior and intelligence. However, despite those with more human-like intelligence, BEAST-Types tend to revert to a more primal state, becoming aggressive and violent. No matter how close in thought and intelligence BEAST-Types can be to humans, BEAST-Types have shown they cannot determine the gravity of death.
{-} *********BEAST-Types*********** Unknown Type Part 2 Almost all BEAST-Types have the ability to alter their form into different stages. They derive their name from the enormity and aggression of their largest form. Some can change willingly, others seem to do it without realizing it. They typically do not hold their largest aggressive form for very long. However, they have been known to wipe out entire villages and towns during that time. Different kingdoms have different ways of dealing with BEAST-Types. Due to their dangerous nature and threat, many have them killed on the spot.
{Y} ? Seems like a book was taken out of here recently..
{-} ******* Demons and Angels******* Myths, Stories and Lore {Y} I’m not too interested in this.
{Y} There’s a lot of textbooks and learning materials here. Whenever Claire wants something, I usually pick it up for her here. ..I wish she didn’t incur all the late fees under my name.
{-} I like to come to the library often, it’s a nice and quiet place to think and reflect on life
{-} Do you have any favorite books? I personally like heavy fantasy and myths! Romance too!

{Y} The fitting room... I guess it wouldn’t hurt to try on some clothes.
{-} Thank you for stopping by! Have a nice day!!
{-} Oh? You’re back in Town, Yoki? Got another job from the Prince? {Y} I’m not sure yet... I just wanted to take a small walk is all
{-} Things have been pretty tense in Town lately. With all the BEAST-Types showin’ up recently, everyone’s on edge.
{-} Since more BEAST-Types have been showing up, Taxes have been going through the roof. I don’t know how much more I can handle this...
{-} Town Tailors
{-} I wanna quit my job and become an apprentice to the Tailors. They’re so cute...
{-} Wow! You have a tail! You’re so cool! I want to be like you when I grow up
{-} How do I grow antennae? {Y} (...)
{-} Town Library
{-} Town INN
{-} I sure could go for a bite to eat
{-} I heard Caina opened up a Cafe some time ago in the Village near here. I should stop by sometime.
{-} You have antennae! And a tail! Are you a BEAST-Type? {Y} No... I’m not
{-} I hear the Village near here is filled with people with animal parts! That means they’re all BEAST-Types, right? {Y} Not quite... They are still human.
{-} Oh? What are you doing here?
{-} We won’t let anyone set foot in the Prince’s room
{-} Well, I guess it’s fine if it’s you.
{-} None may enter the Prince’s room
{-} Go ahead, we ain’t stopping ya.
{-} Halt! ... / Soldier A: Well, It’s Yoki. It’ll probably be fine if she enters the Prince’s room. Soldier B: Yea I don’t wanna mess with ya. {Y} Thanks... I think.
{-} You’re awake early for a weekend, aren’t you? Don’t you usually sleep in on these days? {Y} I do, but I didn’t sleep too well last night. (I have been a bit more tired than usual lately...) (Probably because of all these nightmares...
{-} The Prince hasn’t been sleeping too well lately either. Probably because he stays up late working... There’s so much work these days.
{-} Causing any trouble today? {Y} No... I haven’t done anything
{-} The Prince makes so many exceptions to the laws and rules for you. It makes others very suspicious and concerned...
{C} Yo! Good morning, Yoki! Aren’t you awake kind of early? {Y} Good morning Claire. It is pretty early, huh? I haven’t been sleeping all that well lately... {C} Mm...Yeah.. You don’t look so great these days. Was it another nightmare? {Y} Yeah... I’ve been getting them a lot more recently. I can’t remember the last time I got a good full night’s rest. This one was especially draining. I feel beyond exhausted. {C} mm... You know... / I’m thinking... It was probably HIS doing again. You know... ...Zera. {Y} Yeah. I was thinking the same thing... Usually with his nightmares, they end with some kind of EYE looking back at me. {C} I was also thinking it was him because I saw him by the front door earlier. {Y} Ah. There’s no doubt about it then. It was him. These nightmares feel much more aggressive lately. Wonder if he’s mad at me... / {Y} Man what’s with that guy? Why’s he so fixated on you? Think he’s got a crush? {Y} I don’t think it’s that... {C} Well whatever it is... Seriously, be careful around him. If I could get rid of him myself, I totally would. I put up so many spell barriers around the house... ..and he just comes in and breaks them like it was nothing. / {Y} Don’t worry about me. If it ever came down to it... If he ever tried anything... I can take care of myself, I’m not scared of him. / {C} Ooohhhhh! You’re so cool! After all, It’s not like he’s ever tricked you or roped you into his schemes before. {Y} ............

This one was especially draining. I feel beyond exhausted. {C} mm... You know... / I’m thinking... It was probably HIS doing again. You know... ...Zera. {Y} Yeah... I saw him outside next to the house after all... {C} Ugh, he’s still there? {Y} So you saw him earlier too then, huh... These nightmares feel much more aggressive lately. Wonder if he’s mad at me... / {Y} Man what’s with that guy? Why’s he so fixated on you? Think he’s got a crush? {Y} I don’t think it’s that... {C} Well whatever it is...

{C} Hey, if you’re heading out... Do you think you can pick up my order from the Doctor’s place in the Castle Town? {Y} Sure thing, if I end up heading that way. {C} Thanks a bunch
{C} Hey, if you’re heading out again... Do you think you can pick up my order from the Doctor’s place in the Castle Town? {Y} Oh.... I already dropped by there.. I didn’t.. know.. {C} What!? You already.. went to the Town and back? Aww man.. {Y} Ah... It’s ok, I don’t mind going back... I can still get your stuff. {C} Yay! You’re so wonderful
{C} Did you pick up my stuff yet? From the Castle Town Doctor, in case you forgot. {Y} No... Not yet. {C} Awww booooo
{C} Wowwww! You brought my stuff! Thanks sooo much! {Y} Sure thing. I’m assuming these are ingredients for witchcraft. {C} Yup! They sure are! And these are especially hard to come by. {Y} What are these ingredients for this time..? The doctor’s tone really changed when I brought up the order... / {C} It’s umm... The commission this time is a little unpleasant. {Y} .... {C} .......... / ...Just kidding! It’s for healing potions. / Witchcraft is used for more than just vile reasons like making poisons or curses. Though I guess I’ve taken on a few of those types of jobs before... {Y} If these ingredients help people, why do they have to be obtained so sneakily? {C} The only use for these types of unique items are formula relating to Witchcraft... And ingredients like these tend to have uses in more than just one formula. Some being... very deadly or dangerous. To reduce the risk of these being used for some dangerous stuff... / ..It’s all just outlawed. Annoying, right? {Y} I guess I understand.. / {C} Anyway, I have the ingredients now. But... I don’t have to make the potions right away. Why don’t I take you out for a flight on my broom? That always makes me feel better when I’m not doing too well. I’ll be waiting for you outside!
{Y} ... / {C} I liked that picture of me so I decided to keep that one
{Y} ...
{Y} Lots of spell books and such. ...Some of these are in languages I’ve never seen before... Claire is really smart.
{Y} Looks like a lot of ingredients for formulas and rituals...
{Y} A lot of old torn up notes and formulas it seems. ..As well as some failed experiments and empty vials.
{C} Hey heyyy! That’s my journal! I don’t go lookin’ through your stuff without your permission! {Y} I’m pretty sure you do... {C} Well... maybe. But don’t look through mine! My stuff is cuuuuuurrrsed! You’ll be haunted! {Y} By who..? {C} By me of course. {Y} You’re right... Wouldn’t want that
{C} Hey hey!! No reading my journal! Just cuz I left for a minute, don’t think I can’t tell when you open my journal!
{Y} ...Organic ingredients for spells and formulas.
{Y} Claire’s latest work... What a strong smell. {C} Wanna try it? {Y} No thank you
{Y} Claire’s latest work.. What a strong smell..
{Y} Looks like these are ingredients ready to use for spells and formulas.
{Y} Claire’s broom. Why does she have so many brooms lying around the house...
{-} Chirp..
{-} Bark!
{W} zzzzzzz {Y} Oh good, she’s asleep. I really don’t feel like dealing with her right now. Well... Really I never do. Maybe she’ll just sleep forever. {W} zzzzz....Y...Yoki... / {Y} ...? Is she... dreaming about me? / {W} zzz... I’ll eat you yet... ....Just you wait... {Y}
{Y} I wonder where she even came from... She showed up just a few years ago and has been a pain ever since. She always seems to be targeting me... I don’t know why... But... Even though she strikes so violently, it sort of feels like... She doesn’t really mean it... Like she knows she can’t REALLY beat me. It’s strange... Have I met her before all of this..
{Y} To be honest... She’s the kind of BEAST-type the Prince would get rid of. She’s the dangerous type that’ll violently attack anyone. But... I have a feeling she’s not really what she seems. I should keep her existence a secret from the Prince. She ‘s never wandered too close to the village. And she only seems interested in attacking me for some reason
{Y} I better leave... I don’t wanna stick around for when she wakes up. {W} zzzzzzzzzz
{Y} (She’s chewing on some grass..)
{-} Rrr..
{-} Ribbit!
{-} Grrr... {Y} (He looks hungry...)
{-} ...
{Y} Well... This wasn’t very hard to find. {C} Yeah, it really stands out. We’ll be the Heroes who beat the Dark Lord in the end. We’ll show that Crystal. {Y} Still bitter about it? {C} Who wouldn’t be!
{-} I’m waiting for the Heroes! I’m not just an ordinary Chest. I actually work for the Dark Lord! {Y} Whoa... This treasure chest talks. {C} What a nasty trick. I like that.
{C} Hey... / Doesn’t it seem a little too... Empty? {Y} It does, doesn’t it... {C} This is the Last Boss, isn’t it? Shouldn’t there be like guards or something? {Y} Maybe we’re just here so early, the Dark Lord’s underlings aren’t ready yet.. Though.. ... I have a really bad feeling about this.
{C} You ready, Yoki? {Y} Ready as I can be... My heart’s actually pounding a bit. This is the real deal, huh? We’re going to come face to face with the Dark Lord. {C} This presence... It’s so strong. {Y} It is... (..Something feels familiar about this..) {C} Alright... Here we go.. It’s... Time. {Y} The Dark Lord. / {Y} So... You are the Dark Lord. / {C} Felt like messin’ up the world, huh? Well, we’re here to stop you. {Y} We may not be Heroes... But that doesn’t mean we can’t be the ones to take you down. {C} Any last words? {-} ???: Oh... So mean. {Y} That... voice..! {C} It can’t be. / {Y} Zera!? What are you doing here? {C} You’ve gotta be kidding me. {Z} I’m so glad to see you two. {C} Well I’m not happy to see you. {Y} Wait... If you’re here... Where’s.. The Dark Lord? {Z} Oh... The man here previously? Someone with the title of “Dark Lord”... I couldn’t have someone like that wandering around in my territory. So... ..I disposed of him. / {C} W-what? {Y} Wait... Does that make YOU the Hero? {Z} Me? A Hero? No, I’m afraid not. The previous Dark Lord’s underlings were impressed by my strength... And so now... They serve me. They made me their new “Dark Lord”. {C} Weren’t you already one? {Z} ... / {C} Aaaahhhhhh... / How anti-climatic. What a waste of an adventure. I’m going home. {Y} Ah... Wait Claire... / {C} It was nice hanging out with you for a bit, Yoki. It’s a shame he ruined it. I’ll see you back at the house, kay? / {Y} ... Well. Guess I’ll get going too... / If I ask you to... Would you spare the Heroes on their way here..? {Z} Unlikely... But I appreciate you coming all the way here, just to see me. {Y} ... / Please... Just go a little easy on them.
{Y} ..? There’s a letter attached to this tree. / ... I can’t read this at all... What language is this..? I’ll put it back I guess. / ... Who could this letter be for this deep in the forest..
{Y} I wonder who this letter could be for...
{-} Howwww
{-} Howwwwl Lost Traveller: What a cute wolf!!
{-} Lost Traveller: A mole..! / Lost Traveller: Ah. it ran away...
{Kr} ... {Y} ...
{Y} Are you guys lost..? We’re pretty deep in the forest. {Zu} Nope. We’re doing just fine. {Y} Are you sure..? We’re pretty far from anywhere. {Zu} Yup. {Y} ...
{L} That’s strange... I can’t sense a fountain anywhere... {Y} Fountain?
{Y} A large dragon statue... Seems to be covered in moss and vines.
{Y} ..? / Who was that?
{Y} ..? (The barrier is broken but...) (Is it really so ineffective right now that someone could wander this far in..?) Hello there... Are you lost? Do you need any help getting back to the Village..? / {D} ... Am I lost..? / Yes... I believe I am... But not in the way you think I am. {Y} Oh... (What does that mean?) / Um... {D} Ah... Yes. I remember you quite well. {Y} ? Have we met somewhere before? {D} We have indeed. At the shrine earlier. {Y} I mean... Before that... {D} Indeed. We have. {Y} ... So uh.. Not to be rude but... Who are you? {D} Who am I..? Yes... Who am I, indeed. / I am a Dragon who you so thoughtlessly beat up not too long ago. {Y} Dragon!? You mean... You were created by Zera!? {D} I was, yes. I was once his familiar. {Y} And now you... aren’t..? {D} That is correct. / {Y} (I didn’t know that.. familiars can stop being... familiars..) But... You don’t LOOK like a Dragon I’ve fought. {D} Yes, I suppose this form isn’t very convincing. / So. Allow me to show you... {Y} !? / {D} Behold! My True appearance. {Y} !? Oh... I see now. That’s a look I recognize. Well, If you still plan to destroy the area, I’ll stop you again. / {D} Hah! You needn’t worry. I will not attack you or anyone near here. I have only one target. / And that is... Zera. {Y} Zera..? Your goal is to kill Zera? That’s... surprising. I certainly have a lot of questions... / {D} I will humor your curiosities to the best of my abilities. {Y} Well to start... I guess it’s no coincidence that you look like the statue at the shrine. {D} That is correct. Zera would frequent the shrines of the Dragon deity. He admired them, and so he’s shaped his creations as such. That is why we have this form. {Y} I didn’t know that Zera’s Dragons thought autonomously... I feel a bit bad now for beating you guys up. (Not that you guys don’t deserve it.) {D} Typically, we do not think with our own minds. Our life is a short one. As our forms are but a collection of energy given life. Each passing moment we exist, we also cease to exist. As the energy that makes us exist is used up, we vanish. / When I clashed with you, you used your power on me. The power that you use to quell what you call BEAST-Types. As a result, while I was blown aback, I absorbed your power. I had been reborn. / And not only that, I had been given the gift of autonomy. I could think for my own. I began to question my own existance and being. This confusion led to hatred. / A hatred for being created to merely be destroyed by your hands. / But, do not worry. I do not harbor such resentments toward you. It was not your will that I was given such a purpose. {Y} You were... Created to be destroyed by me? I always thought he did that on some kind of whim, without much regard if it was you or me that died in the process. {D} On the contrary, your death is the last thing he wants. He prepares you for a day in your near future... {Y} He’s... what? What’s he preparing me for? {D} That I do not know. {Y} I find that hard to believe... He ropes me into schemes or throws me into situations which almost kill me. He gives me those awful Nightmares every other night... If anything, it just seems like he just enjoys toying with me. / {D} He does find amusement in your suffering. {Y} ... / {D} But beyond that, there truly is something you must face in your future. You must be ready for a peril worse than what you’ve faced thus far. Should you successfully complete this challenge ahead... / It is then, you must be wary of Zera. When that time comes, he will be your greatest danger. {Y} ... I wish you could tell me more. / {D} I apologize, this is all that I know. But worry not. / Before such a day comes, I will kill him by my own hands. GUUUOOOOOOOOGH {Y} (If I can beat you...) (I don’t think you stand much of a chance against him...
{Y} So... In what way are you “lost”? {D} I’m lost in purpose. I was created merely to be destroyed by you. But... I no longer desire that. And so, my purpose is lost. {Y} I don’t know if that means you’re lost. I mean, you found a new purpose right? {D} To kill Zera, I suppose. {Y} Well... Sort of. But... I was actually thinking... That your purpose is to keep on living, right? {D} ... Perhaps
{D} Though I’ve grown to despise Zera... I still feel drawn to the shrine of the Dragon deity. I feel a kinship with the forgotten god. Should a god be forgotten, the god ceases to exist. One day, in the same way, I will be forgotten, and simply vanish. But, I will fight to exist until I carry out my revenge on Zera.
{Y} It’s... So hot... Those guys sure are something to be wearing armor in this heat. I shouldn’t fall too far behind... Let’s get a move on.
{Y} ...
{-} Hee Hee... I’m a random encounter. {Y} Shouldn’t you be invisible? {Y} Well I don’t need to be invisible to YOU. {Y} (Somehow I feel hurt...)
{-} Huh? You shouldn’t be here
{-} This area of the dungeon is under construction... I guess it’s too late anyway. The Chosen One has already arrived... {Y} Chosen One..? Do you mean... Me? {-} HA HA HA Of course not. {Y} ...
{Y} It’s empty.
{Y} The switch was already pressed...
{Y} I was hoping nobody would open this chest... I was saving it for me...
{Y} What is this..? ... A Save.. something?
{-} All of the switches have already been activated and the paths have already been cleared... Including this one... But this challenge auto-resets. Hee hee... If you wanna get through, you’ll have to solve it
{-} Hee hee... Did you mess up? I can reset everything for you. {Y} [Please Do/ No it’s fine] # Please Do] Please reset it. {-} You got it! # [No it’s fine] No, I think I can still make it through. {-} Good luck! I had trouble getting through myself.
{-} Our dungeon’s boss... Was defeated by the Heroes. {Y} Heroes? (Guess he means those guys from earlier...) (That makes sense...) (Their goal to defeat the Dark Lord does seem pretty heroic.) (Since I also want to defeat the Dark Lord.. Does that make me a Hero too?) {-} So, are you gonna help us prepare for the next Shrine or what? {Y} (...I guess not.
{Y} Don’t I seem like a Hero to you? {-} HAH! You? Aren’t you one of us? {Y} ...? Well... I intend to defeat the Dark Lord. {-} Huh? You wanna defeat our Lord..? {Y} I do. {-} Why? You wanna be the top dog or somethin’? I guess I could see myself serving you. Your power is incredible. {Y} (That’s... Not why..)
{Y} ..? / {CO} The Crystal... It’s... Reacting to my sword. / {C} Go forth... And accept its blessing. / {CO} Ok... Here goes. / {CO} I feel... A strange new power... {K} This light... It’s healing my wounds. {R} So this is the sacred light. {C} So wonderful... {Y} (Actually, this light is burning me a little.) / {CO} With this power... We’ll be able to defeat the Dark Lord. Let us go, friends! To the next crystal. / {K} Onward! / {C} For the gods! For our future! / {R} For the future, huh? / {Y} Wow... These Heroes are the real deal, huh? Crystals with a holy light... A Chosen One. I’ve only heard of this sorta thing in stories. I’m kinda jealous... Well I guess things will be ok in their hands. ... But... ..I kinda wanna see what happens. Well... It can’t hurt to just follow along and observe.
{C} Hee hee Isn’t this nice? {Y} It is... / {C} Hey... You know... It’s been awhile since we’ve gone off anywhere together. Traveling, adventuring, and whatnot. {Y} Yea... It has been. / But... It can’t be helped. Things have been so busy lately. / {C} That’s true... I’ve gotten so many orders and clients lately, it’s making my head spin. Mostly for wards and health potions too. / It seems like something’s really been stirring up the BEAST-Types lately. {Y} I’ve been getting pulled away a lot for work at the Castle too... It’s taking away from the job I’d rather be working at. / {C} The Post Office you mean? You’re so strong and cool, it seems like a waste to work at a job like that. {Y} I like it. It’s nice to see the other villagers regularly. I like my boss, the work and the atmosphere. It’s very peaceful. Delivering mail is pretty fun and pleasant too. / I like the Prince too... But.. Sometimes the work can be very... Unpleasant. / {C} Yeah... I hear ya... The Prince... I can’t imagine what that guy’s like. His harsh crackdown on Witches and BEAST-Types... Can’t imagine he’s any good. {Y} I think regardless of what kingdom we’re in... It seems like there’ll always be strict rules regarding Witches and BEAST-types. Isn’t the Prince just doing his job? {C} Hmph I just hope the world opens its eyes one day about how great Witchcraft is. Outlawed or not, I’ll always keep up the practice. Personally... I find it very beautiful. People are just scared of it because they don’t understand it. Such a shame. / You know... I think you’re very beautiful too. {Y} Flirting again? {C} Hee hee, You bet! / But I do mean it you know. You’re really different and special. It’s a shame others don’t always see that... / {Y} It can’t be helped. I know I’m pretty strange. Nobody really knows what I am... / Even I’m scared of my own powers and strength. / {C} Like I said before, people are just scared of what they don’t understand. / Some of the villagers have warmed up to you lately. They’re starting to realize there’s nothing to be afraid of. I guess that’s why you like your job so much at the Post Office, huh? / {Y} Yeah, that is a reason. / ... {C} ... / Well! You know, we outcasts gotta stick together! / Who cares if the rest of the world doesn’t agree with us. / I’ll always have you back. {Y} Thanks Claire. I know I can always count on you.
{Y} Nothing to deliver today.
{-} Chirp!Chirp!
{Y} (He has an acorn in his mouth.)
{Y} I feel... Pleasant...
{-} Grrr...
{Y} They won’t let me through...
{Y} ? How’d they get this deep into the forest..?
{-} Lost Traveller: Seems shy...
{-} Moo Lost Traveller: What’s a cow doing this deep in the forest? {Y} Yeah... How strange...
{-} Lost Traveller: This looks a little rough... Let’s turn around. {Y} I agree...
{-} Lost Traveller: This little deer seems hungry...
{-} Lost Traveller: Seems interested in us!
{Y} (This sure is a sign I can’t read from over here.
{-} LEFT: to Village RIGHT: to Castle Town
{-} Lost Traveller: How cute! The bunny wants to play!
{-} Lost Traveller: Hop! Hop! Little frog!
{Y} ..? How did... My journal end up here? (Should I record stuff?) [Yes/No]
{Y} Someone’s been here recently.. / She’s not here.. Wonder if she’s at her cafe in the village..
{Y} Someone’s been here recently.. / {-} Lost Traveller: What a peculiar tree stump! Surely someone comes by here often. {Y} Yeah... I know someone who does. (Someone who likes to come here and spar with me once in awhile..)
{Y} Someone’s been here recently.. / The spot that me and Caina like to spar at sometimes..
{-} Lost Traveller: What a friendly deer!
{-} Lost Traveller: Ow! He threw an acorn at me...
{-} Lost Traveller: She seems to be stomping her foot...
{-} Chirp! Lost Traveller: Energetic little bird!
{-} Lost Traveller: Such a cute baby bunny!
{-} Lost Traveller: Oh! We scared him...
{Y} ..! / {Ca} Urgh..! / {Y} Hah..! / {Ca} Heh! Not bad! After all this time, still strong as ever. {Y} I could say the same for you.. / {Ca} Whew! What a workout! Haven’t felt that adrenaline in ages! I forgot what it felt like to spar with you. {Y} Yeah, that was fun. {Ca} I miss getting to train with you regularly. But... If it means never having to draw my dagger ever again... I don’t mind this being an occasional treat. {Y} Yeah... I still remember when you used to train with me at the Castle. It was so hard to beat you back then. {Ca} And look at you now! Kickin’ my butt like nobody’s business! Training with you back then sure was a highlight during my time at the castle. It’s hard to believe I used to be so wary of you when you first showed up... Sorry about back then. {Y} No worries... I’m usually a bit offputting at first. Anyway... It seems like things worked out pretty nicely for you afterwards. You seem a lot happier these days working at your cafe. {Ca} One of the best decisions I ever made. I heard you took on a side job too with Este at the Post Office, right? {Y} I’d honestly say my work at the Castle is my side job actually... If I could... I’d soley work at the Post Office. But... The Prince wants to keep me under surveillance. {Ca} Eh! I’d say he has you work at the Castle for access to that power of yours. {Y} Well... Yes that’s part of it too. I think the third part of it all is that he’s pretty lonely. {Ca} ..... ...Just take care of yourself, alright? {Y} ..? What do you mean? Where’d that come from? {Ca} I’m sayin’ I don’t trust the Crown. {Y} If you mean the Prince, I think you might have the wrong idea about him. Besides... You didn’t trust me at first either, right? {Ca} This is different! You haven’t seen what I’ve seen... There’s a reason I quit my work and ran of you know! {Y} ..? {Ca} ... Well... Nevermind. You’re pretty strong. You’d be able to handle whatever comes your way. Since the Prince likes you, I bet he won’t let you see anything too messy.. {Y} (..? I wonder what Caina saw that made her quit working at the Castle..) (...) (Oh well...) (If she dislikes the Prince this much...) (I can’t imagine what she’d think of Zera.) / {Ca} Anyway, I’m gonna head back to the cafe now. Feel free to stop by again any time you like!
{E} Do you want me to fly you down the mountain? [Ok/Not right now] # [Ok] {Y} Sure, I’d appreciate that. # [Not right now] {Y} I’m good at the moment, thanks though.
{-} ..?
{Y} ..!
{-} Chirp!
{-} ..!
{-} !!!
{-} ..!
{Ti} Hey! Hey! Wrestle with me!!! {Y} Sorry... I don’t really feel like doing that. {Ti} Hey! Don’t lie to me! I saw you earlier! {Y} ..? / {Ti} You’re really strong! I saw you fighting earlier! With someone else! {Y} (Does she mean with Caina..? She saw that?) {Ti} FIGHT WITH  ME! / FIGHT WITH ME. / {Y} Ah... / {C} Talk about playing rough..... {Y} Tell me about it.... / {C} It’s a good thing I happened to be walking by! {Y} Yeah, that was good timing. I’m not really at my best at the moment. So dealing with this BEAST-Type on my own might’ve been tricky... / {C} She seems so harmless in this form. She’s really no different from a regular cat after all, huh? {Y} Yeah, that ball of yarn you had with you really dealt the final blow. (Also... Why did you have that with you?) {C} Wonder why she was feeling so riled up? {Y} I don’t know... She’s not the only one who’s lashed out at me like this recently. / {C} Well. She shouldn’t be a problem for awhile. {Y} Yeah. She’s really cute in this form. {C} I think she’d make a nice ingredient for my latest work. {Y} ... / {C} Well. I’m headin’ back to the house. I’ll see you later! / {Y} (What was that all about?)
{-} Meow!
{-} Miss? Where did you go!? Hello? {Y} ..Guess the barrier’s too strong for him this far in.
{-} Oh no..! Miss? Where did you go!? {Y} Oops... Not again...
{Y} I wonder what those journal pages were all about..? Maybe I should read them sometime... They shouldn’t be too tough to piece together. Who scattered the pages around everywhere anyway? Did... someone want me to find them..? How strange...
{Y} I never did end up finding those last few journal pages... But... I already know how it ends... I know you’ll come back one day. I have so much I want to tell you. I’ll keep waiting for you in this house.
{Y} ............ I wonder if it was really ok to ignore Zera earlier..? I couldn’t find the last few pages of the journal... Why do I get the feeling he hid them from me out of spite? He wouldn’t do that... Would he?
{Y} ..? How did... My journal end up here? (Should I record stuff?) [Yes/No]
{Y} ...
{-} A little troublemaker, aren't you?
{-} That's my corpse you're standing on.
{Y} There’s a lot of spiders and bugs in this garbage can.
{Y} A journal..? Who does this belong to? Read its contents? [Yes/No] # [Yes] ... Too many pages are missing. # [No] I’ll take a look another time.
{Y} A journal..? Who does this belong to? Read its contents? [Yes/No] # [No] I’ll take a look another time. # [Yes] {-} It was a new morning. Everything was quiet and peaceful. Except for the occasional BEAST-Types prowling about. Nothing out of the ordinary for this place. A place I wanted to stay for the rest of my life, I thought to myself. And then... It was as I was gathering something for breakfast... I saw someone... crying. / Someone this deep in the forest..? Were they lost? I went to take a closer look. / A lone girl, crying all by herself. She looked to be maybe just a little bit younger than me. What was she doing here all by herself? Did she get separated from her parents? Did... She have any parents..? Should I help her..? / My instincts were telling me, “Don’t get involved.” And.. “Don’t let anyone get involved with you.” But... What if she was like me? If she was all alone..? This girl... Could she survive in this forest all on her own? / In the end... I decided to go and see if there was something I could do for her. / I asked her, “What are you doing here all by yourself in the forest?” “Are you lost?” “My.. My sister... I can’t find her..” The girl cried. She had gotten separated from her sister somehow. Well... All I had to do was help her find her sister, right? There’s no way I could leave her alone while she’s this lost and scared... At this rate, she’d be food to any nearby wandering BEAST-Type. / “It’s dangerous here.” I told her. “I’ll help you find your sister.” / As I helped her up, she seemed to calm down, almost immediately. “What’s your name?” I asked her. “..Yoki.” She said. {Y} ... {-} “Ok Yoki. Let’s check the nearby Village.” “Maybe someone there might’ve seen where your sister went.” I told her. / And so... We went to check the nearby Village. / But... It seemed like nobody had seen her sister. / And nobody recognized this girl. The girl barely said anything at all... So I had to speak for her. / Hours had passed... And still not even a hint about her sister’s whereabouts. / With no luck at the Village, I decided maybe it was better to continue this search in the forest. This girl and her sister... Were they travelers? Where did this girl come from? I tried to ask her... But she wouldn’t answer any of my questions. Actually... After I started asking her about her past... / ..She collapsed. Did I push her too hard..? It was getting late, and we were far from the Village. / So... I decided to take her back to the place I was staying at. It’s a little rundown, but it was better than having her sleep out here in the forest. / I thought to myself... It’ll only be one night. Then tomorrow... I’ll leave her with someone at the Village. Someone like me... I don’t know if I can really be of much help to her. Just when I thought my life would be easy and peaceful from here on out... / {Y} This is... HIS journal. ... But... sister..? How strange.. Did I... have a sister..? I’d like to read more.
{Y} Continue reading? [Yes/No] # [Yes] ... Too many pages are missing.
{Y} Continue reading? [Yes/No] # [Yes] The new day soon arrived. As I was preparing for our commute to the Village, I decided to try asking her about her sister one more time. Maybe before I drop her off at the Village, I’ll help her look just a little bit more. But... When I asked her... / “Sister..? I don’t have a sister.” She said. No way... I thought. Was this girl messing with me? I started to get upset. Or... Did she really forget? How could someone forget something like that? ... Well. There was no sense trying to search for someone under these circumstances. Someone in the Village will be able to do a better job than me with this. / And so... We arrived at the Village. / I asked around, seeing if there was someone who can give her a place to stay. I found some people who seemed interested in helping her out. But... No matter where I dropped her of... / ..She’d always find her way back to my place. / Eventually, I stopped trying to leave her with someone in the Village. It was more dangerous to have her wander back on her own than to just let her stay here. / And so... As the days passed, the search for her “sister” would continue. But, she sure wasn’t very helpful with the search. She didn’t know what she was looking for... / During this time, while she was staying here, she would help out with things. She wasn’t very good at helping. But... / It was kind of nice to have company. I never looked after someone like this before. Maybe I wasn’t so terrible at this, I thought. / As time passed... It started to feel like... We were family. Something... I never thought I would have. ... / But... I knew things couldn’t stay this way. The terrifying past that follows me. I can’t let her get caught up in it. If I was tracked all the way here... ... Well... In the meantime... Maybe it’s ok if things stay the way they are for now. Maybe they’ll never find me. I thought. And so... / Years would pass by. I would still try to look for clues about her sister. / But also... during this time.. We grew up together as a family in this place. We started to fix up the house over time. / It really began to feel like... A real Home. / As time passed, I noticed something strange. I learned she was capable of magic. But... It was unlike any magic I’ve ever seen. / With this power... She was able to take down a large rampaging BEAST-Type. And she did it all by herself. / I was worried... Was this a forbidden magic she’s using..? Was it Witchcraft? But.. She doesn’t study any of the practices of Witchcraft. Was she possibly.. A BEAST-Type? But... She didn’t look or act like a BEAST-Type. All I could think was... She needs to keep this power of hers a secret. There’s no way the Crown here would leave her alone if she was found out. {YY} Isn’t my power cool? {Ch} Yoki... You have to promise me you’ll keep this power of yours a secret. Only use it when you are faced with immediate danger. {YY} What? Why? {Ch} We don’t know the origin of it... What kind of magic it is... / And... Recently... I caught wind of something scary. I heard... That the King and Queen have died. I heard they were killed in a battle with a BEAST-Type. / When the Prince learned of this, he was devastated. I heard... He’s become wicked with hatred and bitterness. Any BEAST-Type found, under his order, peaceful or not... ..Are to be eliminated. I’m worried. If you display this power in front of the wrong eyes... ..They’ll consider you a BEAST-Type, and the Prince will have your head. / {YY} Really? That’s not what I’ve heard. I heard he’s been intimidated by everything and cries every night. He’s been too whimpy to succeed the throne and doesn’t leave his room. I’m not scared of that guy. {Ch} Yoki... Listen. It could be very serious if people misinterpret your power. Please promise me you won’t use it in front of people. / {YY} Fine, fine. I’ll try to keep it a secret. I’m not really worried though. / {-} It was then, my past finally caught up to me. / Something more frightening than the Prince or any BEAST-Type. / I knew... There was no way things could last forever. But... I really wanted to believe... / {Y} ... I’ll look for more pages.
{Y} ... Too many pages are missing.
{-} The time had come. I couldn’t wait on this any longer. I had to make a decision. / I agonized over the reality of the situation. It hit me. / It was finally here. What I’d been running from. What I’d kept a secret from Yoki... I knew... ..That I couldn’t tell her about any of this. / I couldn’t let her be involved in my life any longer. Everything will end. I couldn’t let them find out about her. I can’t let them find out about her connection to me. I can’t let them find out about her power... / They were somewhere nearby... They left their traces. I know they did it on purpose. They could be in the Village. They could be in the forest... / I’ll find them. And I’ll lead them away from this place. They’ll never learn about this house. ... / I knew... To protect the only family I’d ever known... / I’d have to disappear. / I wished... That we could’ve lived the rest of our lives together in this house. I’m sorry that I can no longer help you search for your sister. Perhaps there was no void in your heart left by your forgotten sister. But... You helped fill a void in mine. In all our years together, I thought of you as a sister to me. Goodbye. I hope we get to meet again one day. / {YY} ... Are you back yet..? ..Charles? / {Y} ... What was it that you were running from..? Why couldn’t you tell me... We could’ve faced this obstacle together. I wanted to be there for you... ..Like you were for me. / I know you’ll come back one day. I’ll keep the house tidy for you for when you come back. / I think that’s enough for today. I should head back. I’m sure Claire’s wondering where I am.
{Y} There’s nothing more to read.
{Y} This treasure chest is sealed shut. Wonder what got trapped inside.
{Y} There’s no point in trying to get this open. I’m sure it’s not meant for me anyway.
{Y} ...
{Y} ..? There’s something in here... / ... A broken bottle. I see why it was left here. I’ll just put it back.
{Y} ... Why did I check this again...
{-} Hee Hee So, you’ve finally decided to join us. / We’ve been waiting for so long. / Lord Zera will be so pleased. / There’s no turning back now. You are ours. / Hee hee You’ll stay with us. Forever, and ever. And become, one of us. / Hee hee
{Y} So... Cold... I kinda wanna go back to the other location now. Well. As that one hero said... Onward!
{-} Hey! Hang on a second! / {C} Whoaaa!! Slippery!!! / Hi Yoki! I finally caught up with you! {Y} Claire? You followed me? {C} Yeah! I did. It’s really cold here. What are you doing in a place like this? {Y} Well. I decided to follow some heroes here.. {C} Whoa! Are you a hero now? You’re way too cool! {Y} N-No... They don’t know I’m tailing them. They were talking about stopping some kind of Dark Lord... It sounded pretty serious, so I decided to follow them and see what’s up. {C} That does sound pretty concerning. Ok! I’ll come along too then! {Y} Haven’t you already been..? {C} Yeah.
{-} Hee hee... We have the perfect plan to stop those Heroes..! {Y} Hey... What are you guys exactly, anyway? {-} Huh? What do you mean? You’re the same as us! {Y} Uh... No I’m not? {C} ...
{C} Hmm... Looks kind of slippery up ahead. Let’s be careful not to fall off the side. {Y} I’m not too worried. This doesn’t look too tough.
{Y} See? I told you it wasn’t too tough. {C} You’re sooooo amazing! Though, it probably would’ve been easier to just fly over this whole thing, right? {Y} ...
{C} Whooo we made it! Kind of strange how when we fell into a void, we’d just end up back where we began. {Y} Yeah... These places are pretty strange.
{C} Why’d you go and do that? {Y} ...
{Y} (Hey... Isn’t that one of the Heroes..?) / {R} ... So it’s time, huh? {-} Yes... Hee hee... It is time to prove your worth! It is time to attack! {R} ... / Yes... It’s time we end this facade. ... {-} Do not hesitate! And do not hold back. You know what you must do. {R} ... Yeah yeah, I hear you. / {-} Hee hee hee... And with this, it will be the end of those Heroes for good! / {Y} Looks like one of the Heroes is about to betray the others. / {C} That was one of the Heroes? Coulda fooled me. Anyone who betrays their friends like that is no Hero in my eyes. {Y} She seemed kind of hesitant about it though... Don’t you think? {C} No way! I bet she’s the boss of this place. {Y} Well, we’ll see.
{-} Heh? What are you lookin’ at?
{-} Hey... I think that’s the Heroes over there. Hee hee I think the plan is working like a charm! Betrayal is so wonderful!
{-} This is the spot where I respawn. You can’t claim this spot! I already did! Go find some other respawn point! {Y} Respawn? {C} He means the spot you return to after you die. {Y} But... Isn’t death permanent? {C} Yea it is. I don’t understand what you’re confused about. {Y} ...
{CO} I can’t believe... She would betray us like this... What could the reason be..? / {C} We mustn’t be disheartened. We must keep going. / {K} How can you be so cold? She was our friend... Our companion. She’s one of us! / {C} The world is depending on us. We cannot afford to be halted by such a thing. / This is just one of the trials the gods have thrown at us. And we must overcome it. And move on. / {K} Gods my foot! Who cares about some trial? Our friend comes first! / {C} Don’t you dare insult the gods! We must put our personal feelings aside, for the sake of the world! / {CO} Everyone... We have to remain calm! We cannot fight amongst each other! This is exactly what the Dark Lord wants... We cannot play into his hands! / I... I believe in our friend. There must be a reason.. We are the Heroes... Chosen by fate and destiny! / {C} Wow... Looks like some real drama is going down. {Y} So she really did go through with betraying everyone. {C} I told you she was no Hero! I know her type! {Y} I dunno... I’m with the guy with the sword on this... {C} Which one? There’s two of those. {Y} The one who acts like the main character. I believe in her... She seemed troubled about going through with all this. {C} Whatever you say... To be honest though, I don’t really like the Cleric lady either. I don’t care for people who put purpose above their friends. I like the guy with the big sword. His heart’s in the right place.
{Y} Oh.. Maybe we shouldn’t approach them... Or make them aware of us... {C} Why not? I wanna knock some sense into that Cleric. {Y} Let’s just keep moving forward.
{Y} ... What did we just walk in to? {C} Oh! I think I’ve heard of these... I think this is called a Battle System. Never seen one of these myself before. / {Y} Oh look! She’s back in their party again! I knew she wasn’t all bad. {C} Oh... How about that. Guess everything worked out. Don’t think that Cleric’s doing so hot though. {Y} Wish we could find out why she went through all that. Her motivation... {C} Right? We missed the entire backstory! How’d they even get ahead of us, anyway? / {-} Hey! {Y} ? {C} ? {-} What are you doing here? This is MY battle! No one will get in my way! These Heroes’ lives will fall by MY hands!! If you get in the way, I’ll kill you first! {Y} Sorry... {C} Ooohh she’s upset. {CO} What is that..? {Y} Uh oh... {CO} Did she call for backup? {K} She can call or all the help she wants, I’ll slice em’ all down! {R} Um... I don’t think that’s... {Y} Let’s get going Claire... Before this gets too messy. {C} Sounds good to me.
{C} Is this a hotspring? C’mon Yoki! Let’s go for a dip! {Y} We should probably keep moving Claire... I’m sure the Heroes are gonna need this after their battle. I don’t wanna be around for when they get here. {C} Aww booo They might just skip it and use some kind of healing magic instead...
{C} ... {Y} ... We can come visit again tomorrow, ok? I’m sure this hotspring isn’t going anywhere. {C} Yay! I can’t wait!
{-} Are you guys on a date or somethin’? {C} Yea, we are! {Y} N-no we aren’t.. We’re tailing the Heroes.. {-} Oh? Are you a Mid-boss? Ambushing them before a healing area is a fantastic idea! {Y} That’s.. Not why we’re tailing them..
{R} Thank you guys for... Taking me back. Even after all I’ve done... / {CO} Of course! We’re all in this together! / {K} Welcome back to the team! / {C} I’m... Sorry for doubting you. / I’m glad to see you back. / {R} Don’t worry about it. I really messed up, so you had every right to doubt me. / Let’s just keep moving forward. Together... As friends. / Let’s go activate that next Crystal so we can take down the Dark Lord. / {K} Onward! / {R} I wonder who those guys were that showed up during that last battle... / {Y} Well... I’m glad all that got resolved. Seems like things will be uphill for them now. {C} I guess so... Do you really think they’ll be able to beat the Dark Lord guy? {Y} Well. If things get rough for them... We could step in and help them. {C} You sure they won’t confuse us for bad guys and just attack us instead? {Y} I think I might take that risk for them... {C} Well I wouldn’t. {Y} ...
{-} I’m guarding this special treasure! ... The Heroes seem to have skipped this room... So I wonder if I really have to keep guarding this... {Y} What’s in there? {-} A powerful armor upgrade! {C} Armor? How dull. I’m more of a cloth person, myself. {Y} ..The stuff you wear at the start of your adventure? {C} Yea. You can save up your money and just buy better weapons instead. If you’re strong, you don’t really need to upgrade your defenses. {Y} I don’t think you’d be very good at this type of adventure...
{C} Let’s go! The item this guy is guarding is useless. {Y} ...
{Y} Where’d... They go? Did they finish up already? {C} They’re fast, huh. So, what’s this room for? {Y} Oh. I guess you didn’t see last time. Well... / In the last Shrine, there was a room that also looked exactly like this one. But... There was a large Crystal in the middle of the room. It contained some kind of holy light... The Hero that acts like the main character walked up to it... There was then a flash of light, and the Crystal was gone. I guess he fused with it..? / {C} Wow! These Heroes are the real deal, huh? {Y} Yea... I thought the same thing. {C} I’m sad I missed it... I wanna see that. Let’s go catch up to them so we get to see it! {Y} Yea... They couldn’t have gone too far yet.
{Y} A large dragon statue. It’s falling apart... I guess nobody comes by to take care of it.
{Y} A crumbling statue of a forgotten deity of some sort... This has been here for as long as I can remember. ..but I don't think I’ve ever actually seen anyone come here or talk about it. Wonder what this statue’s all about...
{Y} Wonder what this statue’s all about...
{-} Lost Traveller: Seems like this little frog caught a fly!
{-} Lost Traveller: Ah! He jumped into the water..
{-} Lost Traveller: Ah..! {Y} ..? / {-} Lost Traveller: Ah, this will be fine. / {Y} Are you sure you want to stop here? The Village isn’t anywhere near here... {-} That’s quite alright! I believe I’m familiar with this area, we should be near the Castle Town, correct? I’ll just stay the night in the Castle Town and try for the Village again tomorrow. {Y} Are you from around here..? {-} I was born and raised in the Castle Town near here. Left sometime in my late youth to travel the world. It’s been maybe 30 years since I’ve been back here. This Lakefront view here is quite nostalgic to me. I don’t mind spending dome time here. {Y} Ok, if you’re sure... On your next trip to the Village... Make sure to follow the signs so you don’t get lost again.
{-} Thank you for taking me here! Such a lovely view...
{-} Swimming and fishing prohibited due to sightings of BEAST-types in deep waters.
{-} Huh? What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here..
{-} Lord Zera has great plans for you.. Make sure to stay alive until then.. Hee hee
{-} screech!
{-} The sea really washes away all your stresses and worries, huh?
{-} Huh..? ... Please... Don’t tell anyone...
{-} Why not take a look at the view from upstairs? I often find myself staring out at the ocean and losing track of time.
{-} Pretty, right?
{Y} The bed is a bit old.
{Y} A really pretty painting of the ocean...
{Y} I guess this is the Lighthouse’s... Light?
{Y} One of her spears. Where does she even get these..?
{Y} There’s no meat left on these bones.. Seems like she even chewed through the bones..
{Y} Are these that Wolf-girl’s glasses..? Why doesn’t she wear them..? She always runs into trees and walls.
{Y} ... Looks like he’s eaten recently. ... Of all of the BEAST-Types I’ve seen... This serpent is the most docile and friendly. He’s the opposite of the other BEAST-Type he lives with in this cave.
{Y} Looks like he’s eaten recently.
{Y} A haystack. I guess this is where the Wolf-girl sleeps... Seems comfy enough... For a wolf.
{-} Lost Traveller: This little bunny looks tired..!

{-} Lost Traveller: What a beautiful fox!

{-} Lost Traveller: Looks like he’s hiding...
{-} Lost Traveller: Such a pretty deer!
{-} Lost Traveller: She seems a little nervous...
{-} Lost Traveller: Seems a little scared...
{-} Lost Traveller: This boar seems a little mean...
{-} Lost Traveller: Such a fast little squirrel!
{-} It’s strange... No matter how far I walk, it’s like I’m going around in circles. Rumor has it that this forest has been enchanted by a witch. All who enter the forest lose their way. I guess the rumors are true. I’m lost too... {Y} (I guess he’s talking about Claire’s barrier.) (The barrier only activates if strangers get too close to our house.) (Though...) (The barrier should be broken at the moment.) (I guess it’s still in effect enough to make some people lose their way.) {-} Are... Are you not affected by the enchanted forest..!?! Do you think you could help me get out of here? I’ve been looking for the nearby village. {Y} [Help him out/He’ll figure it out] # [Help him out] Ok. Try not to stray too far away from me. {-} Thank you so much!! What a relief to come across someone so kind! # [He’ll figure it out] Sorry... I’m a little busy at the moment. {-} Ah..! It’s ok..! I’m sure I can make it there... Eventually...
{-} Oh? Did you change your mind!? Will you help me? {Y} [Help him out/Nah] # [Help him out] I suppose so... Try not to stray too far away from me. {-} Thank you so much!! What a relief to come across someone so kind! # [Nah] Sorry... {-} Ah..! It’s ok..! If you change your mind... Please let me know..!
{-} Ah! There you are! There was a strange fog... And next thing I knew I was back here. I’ll try to stick to you more closely this time!
{-} Phew... This is... Too much... Don’t worry... I can... Still...
{-} I........ can........ still........ {Y} (Poor guy...)

{-} You’re not thinking of hopping aboard the ship, are you? {Y} I don’t plan on riding the ship... But I might walk around a bit.
{-} If you plan on sailing away on the ship, I’ll have to inform the Prince about this... {Y} Don’t worry... I don’t plan to.
{-} I wanna go on the ship and grab a drink...
{-} This is a nice fishing spot. But... There’s so much cargo on the pier today. Guess a large shipment must’ve come in.
{-} I’m not catching any fish... I wonder what I’m doing wrong...
{-} There was a mysterious man who passed by here earlier. He looked really cool... But kind of scary. It must’ve been my imagination, but I thought I saw him hover above the castle walls. He had... An otherworldly feeling about him...
{-} *sigh* Maybe I should just give up and go home soon...
{Y} ... (I wonder what’s beyond the sea.) (Far off lands... Other kingdoms... New horizons...) (Maybe... people like me.) (But...) (I don’t think the Prince would ever let me go and see for myself.) (I need to stay here anyway. And wait for..) (...)
{Y} ...
{-} Nice day for fishing, isn’t it?

{-} Catching a whole ton of fish today! Lucky me!
{-} You’re not setting out, are you? Eh, go ahead, I won’t tell. {Y} (I wish this was the guard that always catches me when I leave somewhere.)
{-} It always feels strange to walk on land after spending days at sea. I feel like I’m still swaying...
{Y} Hey boss... {E} ... {Y} ... {E} ... {Y} ... {E} ... {Y} ..................... HEY ESTE. / {E} ..? Oh... Hello. Sorry... I wasn’t paying attention... I didn’t notice you walked in. {Y} No worries... I’m a bit out of it myself. (Though, he’s always like this.) {E} Hey... Now that you’re here, there’s some mail that’s been piling up. Can you get around to sending them out? {Y} (Ah... I’m not actually... I didn’t come here for work...) Yea... Sure thing. I’m not scheduled today though... I’ll still get paid, right? / {E} ... {Y} ............ / (H-hey! He zoned out again.)
{E} The letters for you to send out today are on the table over there...
{E} ... {Y} (He looks a bit preoccupied. I’ll go deliver these and talk to him later.)
{Y} ..? He isn’t here... I guess he went out for a bit? ? There’s something let on the desk here. ..It’s money! And a note? “I went out for a bit. Here’s something for your time.” “Thanks for the hard work. –Este” There’... Double my usual pay here... Thanks Este.
{Y} Guess he’s gonna be out for awhile...
{Y} Looks like these are the letters to be sent out today. Guess I’ll go deliver these to the villagers... {-} ** Letter Delivery Quest Start *
{Y} Gotta send these letters out..
{Y} There’s nothing more to deliver today...
{-} Lakefront ahead
{-} Chirp!
{-} Left: Graveyard Right: Path to Castle Town
{-} I’m patrolling the area to make sure there aren’t any suspicious people about. I mean, besides you. {Y} Am I suspicious to you..? {-} Absolutely. But you already know everyone thinks you’re fishy. {Y} I guess so...
{-} There was an odd man with a cape and horns I saw earlier. I tried chasing after him but I lost track of him. Where did he run off to... {Y} (I think I know who that is...)
{-} There aren’t many people traveling through the forest these days... Probably because of the spike in BEAST-Type appearances.
{-} To be honest, I feel a little nervous to be patrolling in the forest too.
{Y} !? / ..What was that all about?
{Y} There’s fish in this barrel.
{-} I love the sea!!
{-} Woof!
{-} The Captain’s quarters are ahead.
{-} *Sigh* I wonder when we’re setting sail... I wanna see my girlfriend again. The sooner we’re done here, the sooner I get to see her again. {Y} Long distance must be though, huh.
{Y} The helm of the ship. I wanna spin it.
{-} This stuff sure is refreshin’!
{-} Huh? Where’d that guy come from?
{-} I’m takin’ a small break before I gotta go back to lifting cargo. Feels like it never ends.
{-} More!! More!! More!!
{-} Heya! Can I get ya anythin’? {Y} Yeah... Can I get a cranberry juice.. ..with some whipped cream on top. {-} Comin’ right up! / {Y} Ahh... So refreshing..! This is exactly what I needed to take my mind off of things! {Z} I agree, it’s quite tasty. {Y} Well... It WAS what I needed. What are you doing here? / {Z} I’m allowed to enjoy a drink myself once in awhile. {Y} Does this stuff even suit your palate? {Z} I’m not the one drinking juice in a- {Y} So you really just walked in here to patronize me, huh? / {Z} Don’t be ashamed, I enjoy cranberry juice too. {Y} That’s your only decent quality. Though I have a feeling what you’re drinking right now isn’t cranberry juice. {Z} Not in this type of establishment, no.
{Y} (I think I’m good for now..)
{Z} ...
{-} Welcome ‘board the ship! {Y} Hello... Is the ship going to head out soon? {-} ‘Fraid not, we be docked fer awhile. ‘Sides... The Prince’d ‘ave me head if we set sail with ye on board. {Y} Yeah... I guess he wouldn’t be too happy.
{-} Why not head below deck ‘n grab a drink? {Y} (That sounds kinda nice actually.)
{Y} The captain’s bed? Even though it looks comfy... It’s hard as a rock.
{Y} ... Why does the captain keep a barrel of fish in his room..?
{Y} A complex looking map..
{Y} A grand view of the ocean.
{Y} A various assortment... ..of captain outfits.
{Y} This barrel has a strong... pickled smell?
{Y} A hammock bed. Looks fun to sleep on.
{-} I heard recently there’s been more aggressive BEAST-Types appearing here in this land. I don’t know if I want to stay here too long...
{-} I wonder where they even come from..?
{-} Oh... Those antennae... ..and that forked tail. You’re that BEAST-Type that works for the Crown... right? {Y} Yeah... Sort of. But I’m not a BEAST-Type. {-} Oh I’m sorry, there’s a lot of rumors spreading around about you. Are you sure you’re not a BEAST-Type? {Y} I’m not... (At least... I don’t think I am.)
{-} You don’t really look like a BEAST-Type... But, BEAST-Types DO transform. So it’s possible you’re just not showing your true colors. {Y} I can’t transform...
{Y} A hammock bed. Looks fun to sleep on.
{Y} Lots of sailor outfits.
{Y} Lots of sailor outfits.
{Y} A very hard bed.
{-} All this stuff’s all gotta go. But, the crews’ on break at the moment.
{-} What’s with such a large shipment this time?
{Y} There’s a very strong odor coming from this barrel...

{Y} This path borders another kingdom. I probably shouldn’t venture too far out... I don’t really have a reason to.
{CO} Well! It is time we set out on our journey! / {C} To prevent unspeakable horrors from unfolding... / {K} To protect our world from a sinister evil! / {R} To defeat the Dark Lord... {CO} Come! Friends! Let us venture forth! / {Y} ..? Dark Lord? That doesn’t sound good... Those guys seem pretty capable... Maybe they can handle this. But... I have a bad feeling about this. Maybe I should follow along just in case.
{C} Was that....Yoki? Where’s she going?
{Y} Well. That was something. I hope the Heroes will be alright...
{-} Oh! I’ve been looking all over for you, Yoki. D-did you leave the kingdom..!? {Y} (Oh... whoops...
{-} I’ll be picking you up here in a few days for the next mission. {Y} Ok.. I’ll meet you here in a few days then. ... ..Do you mind not telling the Prince I left or a bit? {-} S-sorry... I’m going to have to report this to the Prince. {Y} Ah... (He’s going to get so mad at me again...)
{-} WARNING BEAST-type territory ahead Lost Traveller: Good thing we didn’t run into any BEAST-types! I’d have been a goner for sure! {Y} (Yeah, you were really lucky.) (Maybe you being affected by the barrier was for the best...)
{-} Lost Traveller: Seems curious about us!
{-} Looks like he’s looking for acorns!
{-} Grr... Lost Traveller: Ah..! He seems mad at us...
{-} Lost Traveller: Seems a little aggressive...
{-} Bark! Lost Traveller: How cute! A baby fox!
{-} Lost Traveller: Seems he’s interested in us!
{-} NO ENTRY Lost Traveller: Looks a little scary. Let’s avoid this cave!

{-} North: Path up to Mountain Forest South: Lake Front
{-} Lost Traveller: Wow! Such a huge bear! I almost thought he was a BEAST-Type! {Y} Yea... Let’s let him sleep.

{-} ! Sorry... No secrets to find here
{-} Thank you for coming all this way just to see me. {Y} Sure thing...
{-} Ah! This will be fine. / Thank you so much for helping me out of the forest! {Y} Sure thing... / Wonder how he got so deep into the forest... Did he not notice any of the signs...? ...I wonder if Zera had anything to do with it.
{Y} ..? How did... My journal end up here? (Should I record stuff?) [Yes/No]
{-} My mommy told me to stay away from you... She said you were actually a scary BEAST-Type in disguise. You’re not gonna eat me, right? {Y} Don’t worry... I won’t do that
{-} I don’t think you’re really a BEAST-Type! I heard BEAST-Types are big, scary and mean. But you’re really nice!
{-} I was there when you took down that BEAST-Type that stormed into the Village. It was appreciated but... A lot of us didn’t know if YOU were a BEAST-Type. To be honest, I was also scared of you up until recently. But, after you started working at the Post Office and coming by often, I realized you’re pretty alright
{-} Better late than never, right? Other villagers here feel the same! {Y} (...)
{-} My mom wanted me to pick up some stuff from the market. But... I don’t remember what I was supposed to get.
{R} ...
{K} Gotta stock up on some of these incredible armor upgrades!
{C} Such a good variety of supplies to choose from in such a small village.
{CO} Hmm... What should we bring with us on our journey?
{-} What to buy..?
{-} Oh! It’s the delivery girl! You’ve been doing a great job! Before you used to deliver the mail, it used to be Este, But... We’d always get our mail at weird hours, or it would be several days late. It’s so much better now that you deliver everything! {Y} Thank you... I think he tries his best though. (..With how spacey Este can be, I can’t imagine anyone EVER got their mail.
{-} I remember when the rest of the Village was scared of you... I was too... Not Este though! Este was never afraid of you, he even gave you a job after you came back from the Castle! Este is a really nice guy! He’s just.. not so organized or time efficient.
{-} If you walk west, you’ll hit the kingdom’s border. I’ve never gone that far... I’m kinda curious what the next kingdom over is like. {Y} (I’d like to travel out again soon...) (Though, The Prince throws a fit whenever he finds out I leave.
{-} Wonder what it’s like out there
{-} I saw someone with a very peculiar presence just walk by... Wonder where he was off to.
{Y} Oh... Here’s where you went. {E} Good work today. If you want, I can fly you back up the mountain.. [Ok/Not right now] # [Ok] {Y} Sure, I’d appreciate that. # [Not right now] {Y} I’m good at the moment, thanks though
{E} Do you want me to fly you up the mountain? [Ok/Not right now] # [Ok] {Y} Sure, I’d appreciate that. # [Not right now] {Y} I’m good at the moment, thanks though.

{Y} One down... two to go
{Y} One more to go

{-} I just moved here from the Castle Town that’s a bit of a distance from here. I’m waiting for some things to arrive in the mail that my family is sending over. They sure are taking their time
{-} Oh! Is this for me? {Y} Yeah. I’m here to deliver these. / {-} Thank you! I’ve been waiting forever for these! {Y} You’re welcome. I hope you like the village. {-} I definitely will if everyone here is as kind as you! / {Y} One down... two to go

{-} Oh! Is this for me? {Y} Yeah. I’m here to deliver these. / {-} Thank you! I’ve been waiting forever for these!  {Y} You’re welcome. I hope you like the village. {-} I definitely will if everyone here is as kind as you! / {Y} (Looks like all the letters have been delivered..) (I should head back to the Post Office.
{-} I’m so glad my stuff arrived in the mail! I was so worried that my family forgot to send these out! Or even worse.. That it got lost in transit!
{Y} The sink seems like it’s in working condition.
{Y} ..I feel like I shouldn’t look through other people’s fridges.
{Y} Looks like they’ve been writing several letters.
{Y} There’s a lot of boxes here. Guess they moved in recently.
{Y} There’s some more boxes underneath the bed.
{-} Hello... What are you doing in my home? {Y} Oh... um
{-} Oh, hello. Why are you in my home? Oh, do you have my mail? {Y} I do... / {-} Thank you so much! {Y} Sure thing. / One down... two to go

{-} Thank you or giving me my mail! I’ll make you some tea and cookies next time
{-} Oh, are you the delivery girl? Thank you for delivering my mail earlier. It’s arrived safe and sound!
{Y} Are these.. Love letters? I shouldn’t be looking at these...
{Y} The sink is filled with dirty plates and kitchen utensils.
{Y} There’s a really tasty smell coming from the oven.
{Y} ..I feel like I shouldn’t look through other people’s fridges.
{Y} There’s some plates stacked up here. Wonder if they’re expecting company...
{Y} A large plate that’s been covered. Guess there’s a nice meal underneath...
{-} Hi delivery girl! Got any mail for me today? {Y} No, nothing yet... I’m not working at the moment. {-} Aw ok, I see! I’m waiting on a few letters to arrive
{-} Hello delivery girl! {Y} Hello... I have some letters to deliver... / {-} Thanks so much! I’ve been waiting on these. {Y} No problem. / One down... two to go

{-} Thanks for the delivery, delivery girl! If you’re tired from your commute from the mountain, feel free to a rest upstairs sometime
{-} Thanks for the delivery, delivery girl! If you’re tired from your commute from the mountain, feel free to a rest upstairs sometime! Well, except for today! There’s someone staying upstairs today
{-} You delivered my mail in my mailbox earlier, right delivery girl? Thanks so much! If you’re tired from your commute from the mountain, feel free to take a rest upstairs sometime
{-} You delivered my mail in my mailbox earlier, right delivery girl? Thanks so much! If you’re tired from your commute from the mountain, feel free to take a rest upstairs sometime! Well, except for today! There’s someone staying upstairs today.
{Y} An empty garbage.
{Y} ..I feel like I shouldn’t look through other people’s fridges.
{Y} Seems like nothing’s in the oven.
{Y} Seems like she’s waiting on some mail...
{-} Phew! I’m beat! Thanks for helping me out of the forest earlier! I think sometime tomorrow... I want to try to find the Lake front I grew up by. {Y} Are you from around here..? {-} Yes I am, in fact! I grew up in the Castle Town that’s a bit a ways from here. Though... It’s been so long since I’ve been back here. It seems I’ve forgotten all the routes I used to know here. {Y} Well... If you find me tomorrow, I can take you there if you’d like. {-} Ooohh I’d really appreciate that. What a kind person you are
{-} I’m really looking forward to seeing that nostalgic view once again...
{Y} It’s bright and sunny out.
{Y} A guest bed. I guess it’s being well kept for someone...
{Y} The garbage is empty.
{Y} I can’t read the sign from here
{-} WARNING BEAST-type territory ahead Lost Traveller: Good thing we didn’t run into any BEAST-types! I’d have been a goner for sure! {Y} (Yeah, you were really lucky.) (Maybe you being affected by the barrier was for the best...)
{-} Chirp!
{-} South: Village
{Y} Breezy... {C} I like this Shrine. It’s more of my element. {Y} I don’t see the Heroes anywhere... Are we that far behind? Let’s try to catch up to them. {C} Aye aye captain.
{Y} Ahhhhh .. . . That... was... {C} I’m gonna hurl.
{-} It’s so windy up here. I’m actually really scared of heights.
{-} I’m lost...
{Y} How are we supposed to cross this..? / I don’t see any of those spinning warps for this. Did the Heroes already figure it out? {C} I know how to get over this. / {Y} How so? {C} Like this. / {Y} Um... I don’t think this is how you’re supposed to solve this... {C} As long as we get to the other side, who cares right? {Y} I feel kind of guilty though... It feels like cheating. {C} It’s not like this is our adventure, we don’t need to follow the rules. {Y} I guess you’re right... / {C} See! Easy, right? {Y} ...
{Y} The... Crystal’s still here. {C} Wow! Look at that thing! {Y} We somehow arrived before the Heroes..? / Where could they be then? If they’re not here... {C} Maybe they haven’t even made it to this Shrine yet. I didn’t see anyone in their group who looked like they could fly. You do need to have the ability to fly to even get in here. Maybe they’re in some other Shrine to get an item for this Shrine? {Y} Ah. I see. I didn’t even consider that. Maybe that’s why this Shrine was so short... / Well... We did sort of just guess they’d be here. It’s not like we followed them in here this time. / {C} More like with the powers of deduction! This is a floating building in the sky. How could this place NOT be a location for a Hero’s quest? / {Y} I guess. {C} Anyway! / I wanna see what this Crystal’s all about! {Y} Be careful, Claire. When the Heroes activated one earlier, the light it emitted burnt me a little. {C} It’ll be fine! Just a light touch! / {Y} Are you alright!? {C} Ooooooooowww... / Guess the Crystal doesn’t like us so much... {Y} Yea. Guess it’s because we’re not the Chosen One... Or a Hero. {C} Hmph! Let’s just skip the next Shrines and go right to the Dark Lord’s place. I’m tired of this adventure. {Y} Yea, I guess there isn’t much of a reason for us to keep following the Heroes. It can’t be too hard to figure out where the Dark Lord’s place is. {C} Let’s goooo.
{Y} Of course you’re here, Zera. / {Z} You don’t look so happy to see me. {Y} I’m never happy to see you. / {Z} Oh... So mean. {Y} So... What is it. Why are you here? / {Z} I’m just dropping by to visit my favorite forest resident. {Y} And what else? / {Z} That’s all. {Y} ... {Z} ... {Y} I don’t buy that for a second. You planted that nightmare I had last night in my head, right? {Z} ... {Y} Don’t give the silent treatment. You want me to be useful to your plans and such, right? Would I really be of any use to you when I’m this fatigued? What’s the point of doing this? / {Z} It’s my way of showing I care for you. {Y} Maybe you should care a little less. / {Z}
{Y} How long are you gonna stand next to the house? {Z} How long would you like me to stay? {Y}  You could leave now if you’d like.
{C} Heya! Wanna go for a flight on my broom together? {Y} [Sure/Not right now] # [Sure] {C} Alrighty! Let’s go! {Y} I didn’t even say yes yet... # [Not right now] Maybe a little later. {C} Whaaat? Booo Just say yes! {Y} .
{C} That was fun! Let’s go again some time! {Y} Yeah. Let’s do it again sometime soon
{C} ..What’s up? You look pretty down. Are you ok? {Y} I’m ok! Just had a long walk, I’m just tired is all. I managed to clear my head from that awful nightmare I had earlier. {C} ...
{Y} No mail today.
{Y} Some vegetables me and Claire have been growing.

{Y} Our well... I don’t really need any water right now.
{H} Ohhhh it’s you! I’ve known you since you were very little. I’ve been watching you over the years. You’ve grown so much... ...and look sooooo much more tasty. {Y} I think I remember you... I don’t recall you ever wanting to eat me though. I thought you were a more peaceful BEAST-Type. {H} I am peaceful! I won’t eat anything that’s alive. I only eat what’s already dead. {Y} Ah... So you’re a scavenger
{H} I’ve been waiting for you to die ever since I laid my eyes on you. I can’t wait for that day! {Y} Don’t look so enthusiastic... {H} The man who visits you... He also looks sooo tasty. {Y} (Is she talking about Zera?)
{C} Hey Yoki! Welcome back.... ..What’s up? You look pretty down. Are you ok? {Y} I’m ok! Just had a long walk, I’m just tired is all. I managed to clear my head from that awful nightmare I had earlier. So.. I’m gonna head to bed, ok? {C} Ok..! Sweet dreams! / ... I’m worried about you.. Ya know
{C} Are.. you sure you don’t wanna tell me what’s really on your mind? {Y} Really, I’m alright Claire. But, I really appreciate your concern. It means a lot. So.. I’m gonna head to bed, ok? {C} Ok..! Sweet dreams! / ... I’m worried about you.. Ya know?
{Y} A nice painting...
{Y} The sun’s out... It’s too bright right now to turn the lamp on.
{Y} It’s bright and sunny out...
{Y} Claire’s spare broom... I can’t use it to fly though. I just clean with it.
{Y} The sun’s out... It’s too bright right now to turn the lamp on.
{Y} The livingroom couch... AKA Claire’s bed... I wish she’d just use the guest bed upstairs. I guess I’m pretty guilty of falling asleep on it too though...
{Y} The fridge is pretty empty... I should do some shopping in the village soon.
{Y} The stove... ..I have so many unpleasant stories involving this thing.
{Y} I should cook this fish soon.
{Y} Always good to wash your hands before you prepare food.
{Y} My old bed. I guess it’s now the guest bed... To be honest, I don’t know why Claire doesn’t use this bed.. This room was supposed to be for her... But she just sleeps on the couch downstairs.
{Y} A photo of..
{Y} A spare wardrobe... It has some of my old clothes and Claire’s outfits mixed in there.
{Y} A spare broom stick.
{Y} My old journal. I filled up all the pages so I have a new one now in my room... ... I’m too embarrassed to read my old journal entries.
{Y} It’s my bed. Go to sleep? [Yes/No] # [Yes] .................. I haven’t even left the room yet... Should I really..? [Yes/No] ## [Yes] Well... Maybe I just won’t have any more nightmares... ## [No] Of course... I haven’t even left the room yet. # [No] Of course... I haven’t even left the room yet
{Y} It’s my bed.. Go to sleep? [Yes/No] # [Yes] I’m still feeling a little restless... Should I really..? [Yes/No] ## [Yes] I guess I walked around enough. Hopefully it was enough for me to get some better sleep. ## [No] I’m not feeling too worn out yet. I don’t think I’d sleep well if I went to bed now. # [No] I’m not feeling too worn out yet. I don’t think I’d sleep well if I went to bed now
{Y} It’s my bed.. Go to sleep? [Yes/No] # [Yes] I’m feeling pretty good about heading back to bed. But... Was there anything else I wanted to do..? Should I sleep..? [Yes/No] ## [Yes] Probably not... Whatever it was, I’ll just do it tomorrow. I’m beat. ## [No] Hm... I think there’s still some stuff I wanted to do. # [No] Hm... I think there’s still some stuff I wanted to do.
{Y} It’s bright and sunny out.
{Y} Oh... I forgot about these apples I left here. // They still seem good... I’ll eat one later though.
{Y} Checking my schedule... Seems like I don’t have work today. Well... I usually don’t work on weekends.
{Y} My garbage can... I should really empty it out soon, it’s starting to smell. ..? There’s a crumpled up note in here that says... “Hold Shift to move faster.” What is... “Shift”?
{Y} I don’t need to change clothes... What I’m wearing right now is fine. It’s not like I have much variety anyway... Maybe I should pick up some new clothes sometime in town.
{Y} The sun’s out. It’s too bright right now to use my lamp...
{Y} Maybe writing a journal might help take my mind off things... (Should I record stuff?) [Yes/No] # [No] I don’t have too much to write about right now anyway... # [Yes
{Y} (Should I record stuff?) [Yes/No] # [No] I don’t have too much to write about right now anyway... # [Yes]
{Y} .............!!! / ............... / ....Another nightmare.. / I’ve been getting a lot of these lately.... / ... / ..I have a feeling HE’s behind this one again. ........ / I don’t think I can fall back asleep after THAT. ... / Well... No use laying around in bed. / Guess I’ll go for a walk to clear my mind a bit.
{Y} ... / I wonder how long this will go on for. Claire living here... My work at the Post Office... Work at the Castle... Zera’s visits... ... I thought Charles would stay here forever. But... One day... He just left. Will everything I have now... These peaceful days... Will it all vanish too? / No... I shouldn’t think this way. / Charles will come back one day. And... Nothing will vanish if I work to make sure it doesn’t. / That was quite a long stroll I think I could probably get some good sleep finally. / Something that still bothers me... A sister... ..Did I have a sister? What was my life like before I met Charles..? Why can’t I... remember... / {-} Hmm hmm hmm... Think what you like. Stay as blissfully ignorant as you are now. That’ll make everything easier. In time.. / Everything you are.. will be mine. Enjoy these remaining peaceful days while it lasts. / .. She won’t be able to hold it back anymore. Her influence will reach here soon. I’ll make sure you’re ready, Yoki.
{-} How unkind of you to just ignore me like that. / {Y} ... Oh.. Sorry, was that you standing next to the front door earlier? I didn’t notice. {Z} You know I don’t appreciate being treated like this. It’s quite disrespectful. {Y} ......Like you’re one to talk. When have you ever shown any courtesy toward me? ... / ........................... (What’s... with this intimidating aura?) (Is he really that upset over being ignored earlier..?) (W-why..? Of all things...) {Z} I do this for your own good, you know. {Y} ? (Is he talking about the nightmares..?) / {Z} You’ll see one day. {Y} I don’t see how planting bad dreams in my head every night is helpful at all. / {Z} ... / {Y} That guy... As mysterious as ever.
{Y} ...Why do I have a feeling I won’t be having pleasant dreams any time soon.
{Y} Is that a portrait of himself..? ..! It... smiled back at me... Why’s his house so creepy..?
{Y} What an impressive looking sword.
{-} You saw it, didn’t you
{-} There are many different crystals that exist. Ones that contain a holy light, ones that hurt us.. And the ones we are connected to. The ones that give us life. The ones we give life to. And so, what about you? What is your relationship to these crystals
{-} In the end, maybe you are not so different from us. {Y} I think I’m very different from you...
{-} Miss? Where did you go!? Hello? {Y} ..Guess this is Zera’s doing. He probably doesn’t want any visitors
{-} Oh no..! Miss? Where did you go!? {Y} Oops... Not again...
{Y} ... There’s nothing in here.
{Y} These beds are surprisingly very soft and fluffy.
{-} Those of us who work for Lord Zera have either been created by him... ..Or have been acquired by him
{-} We’ll acquire you one day, too. {Y} I don’t think so
{-} You’ve spoken with the Dragon familiar who’s obtained his own Being... We will squash that pest.
{-} It is always a pleasure to see you again, Miss Yoki
{-} There’s always a place for you here
{-} Did you enjoy your stroll to the Crown’s castle? Ours is much better, don’t you agree? {Y} How did you know I went there..
{-} This is a room being kept for a certain someone. We tidy it up everyday as we wait for the day they join us. {Y} And... Who would that someone be?
{Y} My reflection... ..! Did it just smile back at me..?
{Y} Isn’t it sunny out..? It looks like night-time from this window. Is the glass tinted..?
{Y} (If I don’t even want to sleep in my own bed, why would I sleep here?
{Y}
{Y} ... Maybe... Just a small nap..
{Y} A fancy lamp. That seems to emanate a dark aura...
{-} Oh, what an unexpected surprise! I will have some tea and snacks prepared for you immediately. {Y} No need
{-} Hmm... What kind of drink should I get for you..? {Y} Really.. Don’t worry about it
{-} Not even cranberry juice? {Y} Well..
{Y} A pristine sink... Not a single plate in there.
{Y} Isn’t it sunny out..? It looks like night-time from this window. Is the glass tinted..?
{Y} Something smells really good... They won’t trick me with tasty food. ...I do wonder what they’re baking though.
{-} Oh! You’ve come, Miss! Is there anything I can get you? Stay as long as you like
{-} I can make you any food you like... If you would stay here, I could make anything for you, forever.
{Y} I feel like I shouldn’t look through his fridge... I don’t want to know what that guy eats.
{Y} This crystal... It’s weirdly soothing...
{Y} My reflection... ..! It started laughing.
{Y} What an impressive looking sword...
{Y} My reflection... ..! Why did it make a pained expression..?
{Y} ...
{Y} My reflection... ..! Why does it look like I started crying..?
{-} Sorry, not even you may enter Lord Zera’s room.
