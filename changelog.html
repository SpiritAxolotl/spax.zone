                - Took the suicide page redirect off the pages I put it on<br>
                - Added a custom background<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; • Planning on putting a parallax effect on it in the near future (gonna try do it tomorrow)<br>
                - For some reason the local font wasn't being loaded in correctly so I fixed that<br>
                - At the same time I added .woff and .otf to the existing .ttf font format<br>
                - Started updating this changelog page so I don't regret not doing it in the future<br>
                - Made the text and images in the text box unselectable cuz why does it need to be<br>
                - Added three new faces to my character sprites ("Woo!", "Enraged", and "Sleep")<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; • (The latter of which looks kinda stupid so I might ask someone to help me fix it)<br>
                - Fixed the text alignment on all the pages to be accurate (and made this page's text box width larger)<br>
                - Made the school site into what I'll call "Manual Mode" where I'll update it manually until I fix the javascript

                <u>Saturday, Feb 12, 2022</u><br>
                - Worked on getting a better custom DEP font for the past 3 days and finally got it exported<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; • Went through 6 betas until it comfortably stayed at v1.06<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; • Tweaks just consisted of height changes for a few characters so they could align better<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; • Huge thanks to Caylie for providing resources to help me get this font from idea to reality<br>
                - Added the custom font to the site, and now it is what's currently being used :)<br>
                - Planning on simplifying the edges and releasing that as v2.06 in the very near future<br>
                - On a less bright note, irl controversy made me feel like killing myself so I made a sort of suicide note and made most of the pages redirect to it<br>
                - Also tweaked the text boxes again

                - Tried making the school js better but ended up breaking it<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; • I also added an "is it broken" status at the top<br>
                - That's literally it lmao

                - Fixed text box formatting to be working as intended<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; • It now stays as one size even as the window gets rescaled, and fits the screen snugly on mobile<br>
                - Added a sitelist as a concentrated place to navigate my webpages.<br>
                - Added a planned changes page to act as a documentation for what I want to do with this site. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; • It also acted as a place to publicly thank Mathew for his immense help while creating and updating this site<br>
                - Updated the main page accordingly<br>
                - Uncancerfied the am I at school js so it was easier to read and modify

                Site created. Currently using it to test actual published web development for a big project.<br>
                Added text boxes, a (bad) custom DEP Font, a test main page, and an external style sheet. Attempted to get a javascript library to work.
