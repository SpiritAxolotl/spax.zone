      <a href="./allspaxfaces.html">All Spax Faces</a><br>
      When originally making this site and testing the text box functionality, I went a little too far with a gag and ended up making 14 sprites for my axolotl character. I only ended up using two of them but in this site, you can see all the expressions I made for them! (I spent like two hours on them) <s>(dm me on discord if you wanna redo them for me)</s><br>
      2024 update: these are being redone by <a href="https://ko-fi.com/ouchyzapgun">ouchyzapgun</a>!
