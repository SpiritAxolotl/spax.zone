      hey! I see you're poking around in the devtools. there's not much to see other than
      severely out of date pages, but you can go to them if you'd like!
      these are also the ones that are notable enough to show off, so not everything's here.
      if you *do* wanna see everything, check out the repo! https://spax.zone/repo :3

      Temmie Chang's second RPG, Dweller's Empty Path!<br>
      (THIS IS IN BETA)<br>
      This is technically a mod of the game that adds QoL features and fixes some bugs, but it stays true enough to the original game that I'm fine with hosting that instead.<br>
      The original game can be found <a href="https://tuyoki.itch.io/dwellers-empty-path">here</a>, and the modded one <a href="https://andrewharn.itch.io/dwellers-empty-path-plus">here</a>.<br>
