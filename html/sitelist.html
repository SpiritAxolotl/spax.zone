                This page uses JavaScript to see my schedule and update the text box to state whether I'm currently at school or not, but it doesn't fully work right now. I'll overhaul it another time, but just know that this exists.

                The manually edited changelog for the site. Currently being updated every day I make major changes on the site so that I don't regret not documenting it in the future. (I really need to update this.)

                When originally making this site and testing the text box functionality, I went a little too far with a gag and ended up making 14 sprites for my axolotl character. I only ended up using two of them but in this site, you can see all the expressions I made for them! (No but seriously I spent two fucking hours on them aaaa)

                Here I'll try to do weekly updates stating what I want to change about this site. Just to get my ideas down and so viewers can see them. But yea enjoy my emotional rants here. (I really need to update this too.)

                I collabed with two other people for a Mods Rush in NotITG, and I made this site so that everyone on the team could see each other's times easier!
