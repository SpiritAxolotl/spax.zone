                    Yo! It's me, Spax.

                    This is my kinda publicly viewable list for what I want to change on the site.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box flex-container unselectable">

                    I'm still relatively new to web development and design, so a lot of things that I want to put on here I still have no clue how to do.

            <div class="text-box flex-container unselectable">

                    I mean, even these text boxes! It took almost a week to get them to how they look now! And only with a shit ton of help from someone named Mathew on Discord!
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box flex-container unselectable">

                    (This site would be less than half of what it is now if he didn't help me out at all. I thank him massively.)
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box flex-container unselectable">
                <div>

                        "></img>
                    But yea I guess now I'll talk about things that I'm currently working on or planning on working on for this site. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box flex-container unselectable">
                <div>
                        <img src="
                    ../images/faces/spax/Smirk.png
                        "></img>
                    First, I want to make a real front page. Not like the test/placeholder one I have up at the current moment. I'll move that to a different url like test or something like that.
                </div>
            </div>

                        "></img>
                    Then I want to put actual relevant stuff on the page. Things like my youtube, my modfiles for <a href="https://noti.tg">NotITG</a>, and a few things about my personality, along with relevant links like that <a href="isspaxatschool">school schedule site thing</a>. Speaking of which...

                        "></img>
                    <s>I need to fix the Javascript on that page. It currently only works on the weekends. There's some sort of bug in either the way that I've formatted the code or just the code in general. Might have to use a slightly more reliable system for that... but that's for future me to deal with!</s><br>

                        "></img>
                    I also wanna add backgrounds to all of the pages. Change it from the boring and flat green that it is right now to possibly a repeating image that looks nice. I already have one in mind but I have to edit it a little more for it to look okay.

                        "></img>
                    (I also gotta learn how to even get it to show up properly on the site.)

                        "></img>
                    Another thing I wanna do is add more Spax faces to the existing 14. I'll try to include more emotions and stuff. I already got a few in mind.

                    One of the last things I wanna do is to register a domain name for the site, so that it isn't specifically "github.io". But that also requires money... and I don't have that...

                    <s>This doesn't directly have to do with the site but I want to make a .ttf font from the DEP gamefont. Right now I'm using a font that looks extremely similar to the original font, but if you were to zoom in on some of the characters, you'll see some weird curves and things (especially on the 0-9 numbers).</s>

I'll update this site like every week or so, and I'll put the outdated ones into a folder on the <a href="https://github.com/SpiritAxolotl/spiritaxolotl.github.io">github repo</a>, so you can see the history there.
