      corpse at the secluded grave?

    It was a new morning.
  </article>
  <article>
    Everything was quiet and peaceful.<br>
      Except for the occasional <br>
      BEAST-Types prowling about.
  </article>
  <article>
    Nothing out of the ordinary for<br>
      this place.
  </article>
  <article>
    A place I wanted to stay for the <br>
      rest of my life, I thought to myself.
  </article>
  <article>
    And then...<br>
      It was as I was gathering <br>
      something for breakfast...
  </article>
  <article>
    I saw someone... crying.
  </article>
  <article>
    Someone this deep in the forest..?<br>
      Were they lost?
  </article>
  <article>
    I went to take a closer look.
  </article>
  <article>
    A lone girl, crying all by herself.<br>
      She looked to be maybe just a little<br>
      bit younger than me.
  </article>
  <article>
    What was she doing here all by <br>
      herself?
  </article>
  <article>
    Did she get separated from her <br>
      parents?
  </article>
  <article>
    Did... She have any parents..?
  </article>
  <article>
    Should I help her..?
  </article>
  <article>
    My instincts were telling me,
  </article>
  <article>
    "Don't get involved."  And..<br>
      "Don't let anyone get involved with <br>
      you."
  </article>
  <article>
    But...<br>
      What if she was like me?
  </article>
  <article>
    If she was all alone..?
  </article>
  <article>
    This girl...<br>
      Could she survive in this forest <br>
      all on her own?
  </article>
  <article>
    In the end...
  </article>
  <article>
    I decided to go and see if there<br>
      was something I could do for her.
  </article>
  <article>
    I asked her,<br>
      "What are you doing here all by <br>
      yourself in the forest?"
  </article>
  <article>
    "Are you lost?"
  </article>
  <article>
    "My.. My sister... I can't find her.." <br>
      The girl cried.
  </article>
  <article>
    She had gotten separated from her<br>
      sister somehow.
  </article>
  <article>
    Well... <br>
      All I had to do was help her find <br>
      her sister, right?
  </article>
  <article>
    There's no way I could leave her<br>
      alone while she's this lost and <br>
      scared...
  </article>
  <article>
    At this rate,<br>
      she'd be food to any nearby<br>
      wandering BEAST-Type.
  </article>
  <article>
    "It's dangerous here." I told her.<br>
      "I'll help you find your sister."
  </article>
  <article>
    As I helped her up, she seemed to<br>
      calm down, almost immediately.
  </article>
  <article>
    "What's your name?" I asked her.
  </article>
  <article>
    "..Yoki." She said. 
  </article>
  <article>
    "Ok Yoki. Let's check the nearby <br>
      Village."
  </article>
  <article>
    "Maybe someone there might've <br>
      seen where your sister went." <br>
      I told her.
  </article>
  <article>
    And so...<br>
      We went to check the nearby <br>
      Village.
  </article>
  <article>
    But...
  </article>
  <article>
    It seemed like nobody had seen <br>
      her sister.
  </article>
  <article>
    And nobody recognized this girl.
  </article>
  <article>
    The girl barely said anything at <br>
      all...<br>
      So I had to speak for her.
  </article>
  <article>
    Hours had passed...<br>
      And still not even a hint about her<br>
      sister's whereabouts.
  </article>
  <article>
    With no luck at the Village,<br>
      I decided maybe it was better to<br>
      continue this search in the forest.
  </article>
  <article>
    This girl and her sister...<br>
      Were they travelers?
  </article>
  <article>
    Where did this girl come from?
  </article>
  <article>
    I tried to ask her...<br>
      But she wouldn't answer any of my <br>
      questions.
  </article>
  <article>
    Actually...<br>
      After I started asking her about <br>
      her past...
  </article>
  <article>
    ..She collapsed.
  </article>
  <article>
    Did I push her too hard..?
  </article>
  <article>
    It was getting late, and we were<br>
      far from the Village.
  </article>
  <article>
    So...<br>
      I decided to take her back to the <br>
      place I was staying at.
  </article>
  <article>
    It's a little rundown,<br>
      but it was better than having her <br>
      sleep out here in the forest.
  </article>
  <article>
    I thought to myself...
  </article>
  <article>
    It'll only be one night.<br>
      Then tomorrow... I'll leave her with <br>
      someone at the Village.
  </article>
  <article>
    Someone like me...<br>
      I don't know if I can really be of <br>
      much help to her.
  </article>
  <article>
    Just when I thought my life would <br>
      be easy and peaceful from here on<br>
      out...

    ****Origin and Natural-Types****<br>
                       Part 1
  </article>
  <article>
    The 3 major classifications are:
  </article>
  <article>
    1) Origin-Types,<br>
      2) Natural-Types,<br>
      3) BEAST-Types.
  </article>
  <article>
    Natural-Types develop and share <br>
      physical traits dependent on <br>
      their environment.
  </article>
  <article>
    They typically share features with<br>
      nearby wildlife.
  </article>
  <article>
    However, some have been found to<br>
      rarely adapt plant-like features.
  </article>
  <article>
    Origin-Types on the other hand,
  </article>
  <article>
    are those who do not adapt <br>
      physical traits regardless of <br>
      their environment.
  </article>
  <article>
    Natural-Types and Origin-Types<br>
      are classified as "human".<br>
      BEAST-Types are not.
  </article>
  <article>
    ****Origin and Natural-Types****<br>
                       Part 2
  </article>
  <article>
    After the appearance of<br>
      BEAST-Types, Natural-Types began <br>
      to face prejudice.
  </article>
  <article>
    Since both BEAST-Types and<br>
      Natural-Types can share features<br>
      with wildlife,
  </article>
  <article>
    Origin-Types are sometimes<br>
      defensive and aggressive to<br>
      Natural-Types.
  </article>
  <article>
    This has caused division within<br>
      communities,
  </article>
  <article>
    And some have chosen to live <br>
      seperate from each other as a <br>
      result.
  </article>
  <article>
    *********BEAST-Types***********<br>
               Unknown Type Part 1
  </article>
  <article>
    BEAST-Types, unlike Origin-Types<br>
      and Natural-Types, are not <br>
      defined as "human".
  </article>
  <article>
    Each BEAST-Type is considered <br>
      their own species, unrelated to <br>
      each other.
  </article>
  <article>
    And thus have the overarching<br>
      classification of "BEAST-Type".
  </article>
  <article>
    It is unknown where they come <br>
      from, and have been known to <br>
      simply just "appear".
  </article>
  <article>
    They have a wide-ranging degree<br>
      of intelligence and mannerisms. 
  </article>
  <article>
    Most have been known to have the <br>
      demeanor of wild animals and are <br>
      typically very violent,
  </article>
  <article>
    But there have been documented<br>
      cases of human-like behavior and<br>
      intelligence.
  </article>
  <article>
    However, despite those with more<br>
      human-like intelligence,
  </article>
  <article>
    BEAST-Types tend to revert to a <br>
      more primal state, becoming <br>
      aggressive and violent.
  </article>
  <article>
    No matter how close in thought<br>
      and intelligence BEAST-Types can<br>
      be to humans,
  </article>
  <article>
    BEAST-Types have shown they <br>
      cannot determine the gravity of <br>
      death.
  </article>
  <article>
    *********BEAST-Types***********<br>
               Unknown Type Part 2
  </article>
  <article>
    Almost all BEAST-Types have the <br>
      ability to alter their form into <br>
      different stages.
  </article>
  <article>
    They derive their name from<br>
      the enormity and aggression of <br>
      their largest form.
  </article>
  <article>
    Some can change willingly, others <br>
      seem to do it without realizing it.
  </article>
  <article>
    They typically do not hold their <br>
      largest aggresive form for very <br>
      long.
  </article>
  <article>
    However, they have been known to<br>
      wipe out entire villages and <br>
      towns during that time.
  </article>
  <article>
    Different kingdoms have different<br>
      ways of dealing with BEAST-Types.
  </article>
  <article>
    Due to their dangerous nature<br>
      and threat, many have them killed<br>
      on the spot.

    *******Blessing of Magic********<br>
                A Delicate Balance
  </article>
  <article>
    Some people are born with the<br>
      blessing of magic.
  </article>
  <article>
    The amount of magic that someone <br>
      can be born with varies from <br>
      person to person.
  </article>
  <article>
    From a young age, 
  </article>
  <article>
    Those with magic can be specially <br>
      trained by the Crown in their <br>
      choice of study. 
  </article>
  <article>
    But with a great gift comes great <br>
      responsibility.
  </article>
  <article>
    Those with magic are expected<br>
      to follow strict laws set by the <br>
      Crown.
  </article>
  <article>
    Misuse of magic, such as the <br>
      practice of Witchcraft or other<br>
      forbidden practices,
  </article>
  <article>
    Are subject to strict punishment,<br>
      such as detainment and execution.
  </article>
  <article>
    ********Misuse of Magic********<br>
                      Witchcraft
  </article>
  <article>
    While magic is a subject with<br>
      endless possibilities to create and <br>
      perform the impossible,
  </article>
  <article>
    There are fields of magic that <br>
      are dangerously unpredictable and<br>
      cannot be fully fathomed.
  </article>
  <article>
    To avoid severe consequence and<br>
      danger to the general populace,<br>
      such crafts are forbidden.
  </article>
  <article>
    Witchcraft is a highly forbidden<br>
      practice.
  </article>
  <article>
    It dives into realms beyond <br>
      mortal comprehension,
  </article>
  <article>
    With high consequence and risk to<br>
      every spell or ritual performed, <br>
      even the fully perfected ones.
  </article>
  <article>
    Before its ban, there were many<br>
      who saw its endless possibilities<br>
      and attempted its studies.
  </article>
  <article>
    However, the results of people's<br>
      endeavors were catostrophic and <br>
      have caused countless deaths.
  </article>
  <article>
    As the risk outweighed its promise, <br>
      many kingdoms have deemed it too<br>
      dangerous to pursue its study.
  </article>

    I'd have stepped out by now...<br>
      If it wasn't the High Knight on<br>
      Watch here right now.

  <article>
    She's more commanding and stern <br>
      than the Prince.
  </article>
  <article>
    The Prince isn't even here right<br>
      now.
  </article>
  <article>
    Wish I could step out for a bit.
  </article>
  <article>
    That being said, even the High <br>
      Knight still refers to him as <br>
      "Prince". 
  </article>
  <article>
    When the King and Queen passed<br>
      away,
  </article>
  <article>
    The High Knight consoled the Prince <br>
      and helped give him the confidence <br>
      to ascend the throne. 
  </article>
  <article>
    I think in some ways,<br>
      the High Knight is the Prince's<br>
      confidence.
  </article>
  <article>
    When the Prince is busy with work, <br>
      he always trusts the High Knight<br>
      to fill in for his other duties.
  </article>
  <article>
    The High Knight grew up alongside<br>
      the Prince, so they both trust<br>
      each other greatly.
  </article>
  <article>
    She's worked hard all her life and<br>
      it shows in her skill and diligence.
  </article>
  <article>
    Regardless of what the other <br>
      knights say, I think you're alright.
  </article>
  <article>
    If the Prince has his faith in you,<br>
      then so do I.
  </article>
  <article>
    The Prince is in his office at the <br>
      moment.
  </article>
  <article>
    I think he's been meaning to see <br>
      you anyway, so you should head <br>
      up there.
  </article>
  <article who="yoki" emotion="unsure_smile">
    Oh, I did already.<br>
      Thank you for telling me <br>
      though.
  </article>
  <article>
    The High Knight is nothing to <br>
      sneeze at.
  </article>
  <article>
    Her loyalty to the Crown and<br>
      competence in battle inspires all of <br>
      us.
  </article>
  <article>
    The Prince should be back soon.
  </article>
  <article>
    The High Knight is currently <br>
      dealing with matters here in the<br>
      Prince's stead.
  </article>
  <article>
    The High Knight sure can be scary.
  </article>
  <article>
    I think the fear will keep me awake<br>
      for the rest of the day...

  <article>
    Maybe all night.

  <article>
    I remember the days we kept you<br>
      in here.
  </article>
  <article>
    We all thought you were a <br>
      BEAST-Type.
  </article>
  <article>
    We were so confused as to why <br>
      you were so civil and didn't <br>
      resist.
  </article>
  <article>
    I guess that's why the Prince gave <br>
      you a chance and let you work for <br>
      the Crown.
  </article>
  <article>
    Soldier A: Ah.  You're new here so <br>
      you don't know about Yoki...
  </article>
  <article>
    There was a BEAST-Type that got <br>
      into the nearby Village and really <br>
      wrecked the place a few years ago.
  </article>
  <article>
    A few soldiers were sent over<br>
      there to get rid of it. <br>
      But...
  </article>
  <article>
    When they arrived, they witnessed<br>
      her take it down, ALL by herself!
  </article>
  <article>
    It was unlike anything anybody had <br>
      ever seen... She displayed both <br>
      incredible strength and magic.
  </article>
  <article>
    People were speculating she was <br>
      either a BEAST-Type or a Witch...<br>
      Or maybe even both.
  </article>
  <article>
    Soldier B: Wow!! How creepy!!
  </article>
  <article>
    Did they ever find out what she<br>
      was?
  </article>
  <article>
    Soldier A: No... Nobody was able to <br>
      figure it out. <br>
      Not even she knew apparently.
  </article>
  <article>
    One thing's for sure,
  </article>
  <article>
    If she didn't come in so peacefully,<br>
      she'd have been executed by now <br>
      for sure.
  </article>
  <article>
    Soldier B: I wonder if anyone here<br>
      is even capable of executing her..<br>
      Seems like she'd overpower anyone.
  </article>
  <article>
    It's a good thing she ended up <br>
      being on our side!
  </article>
  <article>
    Soldier A: Eh! <br>
      I don't trust her one bit.
  </article>
  <article>
    There's no way someone like that<br>
      comes out of nowhere and ends up<br>
      being any good.
  </article>
  <article>
    If the Prince had any spine,<br>
      he'd have taken her out himself<br>
      when she got taken in.

    I looked up to the previous King<br>
      a lot.
  </article>
  <article>
    I still mourn his death.

    I try to hold out hope for the<br>

      ever quite be his father.

    I'll take care of her son to the <br>

    We're currently preparing the <br>

    Well, I guess it's fine if it's you.

  <article>
    We won't let anyone set foot in <br>

  </article>
  <article>
    The Prince hasn't been sleeping<br>
      too well lately either.
  </article>
  <article>
    Probably because he stays up late<br>
      working...
  </article>
  <article>
    There's so much work these days.

  <article>
    You're awake early for a weekend,<br>

    *********BEAST-Types***********<br>
            A Theory on Their Origin
  </article>
  <article>
    It is believed that BEAST-Types <br>
      are those who have arrived from <br>
      another world,
  </article>
  <article>
    but are incompatible with the <br>
      world they've entered.
  </article>
  <article>
    This creates an instability in their<br>
      form while retaining varying levels<br>
      of their previous identity.
  </article>
  <article>
    They constantly stablize and<br>
      destabilize their appearance <br>
      based on their emotions.

    I'm guarding this special treasure!
