        I've been in the DEP server for over a year and a half now, and I've been wanting to give back to the community for quite awhile now.
      </article>
      <article who="spax" emotion="woo">
        So now I'm making a webpage that hosts all of DEP's dialogue as seen in-game!
      </article>
      <article who="spax" emotion="look">
        This is still currently a work in progress, and it's going to take a lengthy amount of time to port the dialogue over 100%.
      </article>
      <article who="spax" emotion="smirk">
        But at least I'm doing <i>something</i> for it. Think of it as a passion project for me!

        (Much like how I made a .ttf file of DEP's font too a few weeks ago.)
