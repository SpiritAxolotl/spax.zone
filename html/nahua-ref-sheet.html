        General Lore:<br>
        Nahua is a fallen demigod who takes the form of an anthropomorphic axolotl. Unable to return from Earth, she's taken up the internet as a hobby to try connect with others and live a comfortable life.<br>
        With the power to shapeshift (given enough concentration), she's recently taken up a goopy form, which she has a special comfort in for reasons only known to her. She reverts back to a "solid" form when it feels appropriate to do so, however.

      <article id="clarifications">
        Design notes and clarifications:<br>
        - She has four fingers (as opposed to three or five).<br>
        - Her hair is very kelp-like in texture, and the light blue parts of it can be phosphorescent.<br>
        - Those 6 things behind her head are her gills (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_gills" target="_blank">rami</a>)! I also call them frills.<br>
        - Note the little yellow things next to her eyes. They're little flairs that come off of them rather than actually being on her skin, since it's a bit ambiguous in the ref.<br>
        - She has minor transformative powers (some may call this shapeshifting).<br>
        - She wears an elastic tailband at the base of her tail for comfort reasons! <em>Not optional.</em><br>
        - Her outfit doesn't need to be the one in the ref! She does tend to prefer more open/breathable clothing though. She goes for a tomboy-ish look.<br>
        - Her breasts can be any size up to B-cups (A-cups are usually fine). And tell Spax the word pineapple as proof you read this in its entirety.<br>
        - The headphones are optional rather than encouraged. She has no visible ears.<br>
        - The tip of her tail is a light blue! People often miss this detail.<br>
        - Some words I would use to describe her personality: outgoing, smug, playful, naïve, flirtatious(?), and goofy.<br>
        <!--Old design notes from the slightly older ref (obviously outdated now):
          - Always wears headphones or ear-coverings (she looks weird without them).
          - Doesn’t wear furs (they stick uncomfortably to the mucus on her skin).
          - Yellow eyelash-things are optional, but iconic.
          - As an amphibian, she doesn’t have breasts.
          - Hair is made out of kelp or something, idk. Go wild.
          - Has minor transformative powers (lore).

      <article id="goop">
        GOOP INFORMATION:<br>
        <!--Recently, I have been on this so-called "goop arc". Nahua now has a canon alternative form in which she is goop (a more viscous sort of slime). This is still a very experimental era, so depictions of her as goop won't be scrutinized as much as the "solid" form.<br>-->
        Nahua now has a canon alternative form in which she is goop (a more viscous sort of slime). After almost a year of experimenting with it, I've figured out what things I prefer to be depicted:<br>
        - Her goop is very drippy, but it does so over a more spread out surface area (think honey).<br>
        - Unlike typical slime girls who keep an unobstructed form, Nahua's goop form is always shifting and moving.<br>
        - Parts of her that are more dexterous keep a relatively static form due to concentration on them. The rest of her body has form and physique as more of a suggestion.<br>
        - Her goop is mostly opaque, more akin to an extremely muddy liquid. The more submerged something is in her, the harder it is to see it from the outside. She appears opaque otherwise.<br>
        Here are some relevant pieces of goop art:<br>
