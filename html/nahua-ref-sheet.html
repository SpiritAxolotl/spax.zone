She's shown from the front (both clothed and nude) and back; she looks cheery in the clothed picture and flustered in the nude one, which is censored with an eye-popping emoji graphic. She's wearing shorts, kneesocks, a tanktop with an up arrow on it, and headphones. She is 5 feet 3 inches (160 centimeters) tall, 19 years old, and uses she/they pronouns.">

        Design notes and clarifications:<br>
        - She has four fingers (as opposed to three or five).<br>
        - Her hair is very kelp-like in texture, and the light blue parts of it are phosphorescent.<br>
        - Her gills (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_gills" target="_blank">rami</a>) are indeed stylized like that.<br>
        - Note the little yellow things next to her eyes. They're little flairs that come off of them rather than actually being on her skin, since it's a bit ambiguous in the ref. It's also worth noting that they're optional if you can't seem to get them right.<br>
        - She has minor transformative powers, lore reasons for this will be explained soon-ish.<br>
        - Her outfit doesn't need to be the one in the ref! (In fact, I encourage you to draw her in something else :sob:). She does tend to prefer more open/breathable clothing though. She goes for a tomboy-ish look.<br>
        - (PLEASE don't draw the arrow on her tanktop. TOO MANY PEOPLE have called it a reddit upvote).<br>
        - Her breasts can be any size up to B-cups (A-cups are usually fine). And tell Spax the word pineapple as proof you read this in its entirety.<br>
        - The headphones are optional rather than encouraged. She has no visible ears.<br>
        - She has sharp teeth! Refer to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nikao56.bsky.social/post/3lclevodrvk2m" target="_blank">this piece of art</a>.<br>
        - Her legs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitigrade" target="_blank">digitigrade</a> (high ankle, not flat-footed which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantigrade" target="_blank">plantigrade</a>).<br>
        - Some words I would use to describe her personality: outgoing, smug, playful, naïve, flirtatious(?), and goofy.<br>
        <!--Old design notes from the slightly older ref:
          - Always wears headphones or ear-coverings (she looks weird without them).
          - Doesn’t wear furs (they stick uncomfortably to the mucus on her skin).
          - Yellow eyelash-things are optional, but iconic.
          - As an amphibian, she doesn’t have breasts.
          - Hair is made out of kelp or something, idk. Go wild.
          - Has minor transformative powers (lore).

        GOOP INFORMATION:<br>
        Recently, I have been on this so-called "goop arc". Nahua now has a canon alternative form in which she is goop (a more viscous sort of slime). This is still a very experimental era, so depictions of her as goop won't be scrutinized as much as the "solid" form.<br>
        Here are the relevant pieces of goop art:<br>

      Oh, and you don't need my permission to draw her, but I do ask you to 1) tag my relevant social if you post it somewhere, and 2) not draw nsfw of her unless explicitly given permission from me.
