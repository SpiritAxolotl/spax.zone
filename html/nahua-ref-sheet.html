      No real ref sheet yet...

      Until then, here are a collection of separate reference images:

      Other notes not described on the ref images:<br>
      1. Nahua is female. She goes by she/her pronouns, and is aromantic.<br>
      2. Nahua is <u>FLAT</u>.<br>
      3. If it wasn't obvious, she's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl">axolotl</a>.<br>
      4. She's 19 years old.

      Final clarifications:<br>
      1. The finned part of her tail goes along her spine, as seen in the valentine's day image.<br>
      2. She has four fingers, not three.<br>
      3. She has a full head of hair. She isn't mostly bald like early art depicts her as.<br>
      4. Yes, her gills (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_gills">rami</a>) are stylized like that.<br>
      5. Her headphones are optional? I guess? She'll just look weird without them.
