    <article>

    <article>
      <u>Wednesday, Mar 9, 2022</u><br>
      - Added <a href="./MojoArrowAdvice.html" target="_blank">my create project</a> to the site (was a skeleton page at first because I didn't know how to embed the program)
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Sunday, Mar 6, 2022</u><br>
      - Added the bootstrap locally so that I can work on the site offline without it looking funky and so the code linking the bootstrap looks cleaner overall<br>
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Saturday, Mar 5, 2022</u><br>
      - Tried making the scroll parallax also scroll left for a more interesting look (and failed)<br>
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Thursday, Mar 3, 2022</u><br>
      - Added the text from the intro cutscene to the DEP All Dialogue page<br>
      - Deleted some placeholder text boxes that I was using for that page<br>
      - Fixed some of the CSS with the window rescaling (it snaps correctly now and all the margins are correct)
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Wednesday, Mar 2, 2022</u><br>
      - ADDED MORE .DS_STORE FILES TO THE .GITIGNORE<br>
      - Added the "<a href="./DEPalldialogue.html" target="_blank">All DEP Dialogue</a>" page as a gift to the DEP community<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • I didn't add any text boxes yet; this was just making the site
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Tuesday, Mar 1, 2022</u><br>
      - Fixed some of the linked webpages not working in a few of the files<br>
      - My never-ending journey to make the text boxes the closest to what it looks like in the game continues with a text align fix<br>
      - Updated the <a href="./isspaxatschool.html" target="_blank">Is Spax At School</a> site that removed the not working javascript and added a live time for me (thanks to the MRC3 timezone code I wrote) and included an "I do this at this time" key at the bottom. I will one day come back to fix the javascript.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • Added discord's status colors in the CSS<br>
      - Added a file that makes it so the .html extension doesn't need to be in the url for the site to work
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Monday, Feb 28, 2022</u><br>
      - Added the .DS_Store file (mac metadata for folders) to .gitignore because it sucks<br>
      - Made a beta changes folder and moved the face sprites to a separate image folder<br>
      - Fixed the deleted bootstrap that was causing the text boxes to break<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • At the same time, I updated the "haha edgy" page under my school's wifi and got sent home by my school for it. That was very fun<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • I also had to figure out how to undo commits, which was impossible, so I ended up making a new commit with the old changes reverted
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Thursday, Feb 17, 2022</u><br>
      - Corrected a single error in the MRC3 timezone site and tried to add an automatic refresh (also refactored the javascript)<br>
      - Decided to do a site overhaul with more organized folders and stuff<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • This ended up being a bad idea because when relinking all the pages, I took out some lines of code that I thought I didn't need, one of which being bootstrap, and somehow the text boxes break without it. This drove me nuts
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Wednesday, Feb 16, 2022</u><br>
      - Correctly implemented the background scroll parallax with help from HeySora :tada:<br>
      - Fixed some of page metatada because I forgot to change it when copy/pasting code to make new webpages<br>
      - Added a <a href="./mrc3timezones.html" target="_blank">timezone</a> page for my team participating in MRC3<br>
      - Fixed the weird characters that didn't translate ISO to UTF-8 correctly when copy-pasting stuff in the index.html
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Tuesday, Feb 15, 2022</u><br>
      - Added a "<a href="./contactme.html" target="_blank">contact me</a>" page when I'm supposedly at school (this will probably never get used)<br>
      - Tried to add background parallax
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Monday, Feb 14, 2022</u><br>
      - v2.06 of the DEP font was created (and attempted to share with Temmie on Twitter)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • It aligned a few characters that I forgot about before, but more importantly it simplified the edges so that it uses less points and theoretically renders faster<br>
      - Attempted to add parallax to the background image that now partially works (TYSM MATHEW YA FUCKIN' SAINT)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • Will work on completely fixing tomorrow<br>
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Sunday, Feb 13, 2022</u><br>
      - Took the suicide page redirect off the pages I put it on<br>
      - Added a custom background<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • Planning on putting a parallax effect on it in the near future (gonna try do it tomorrow)<br>
      - For some reason the local font wasn't being loaded in correctly so I fixed that<br>
      - At the same time I added .woff and .otf to the existing .ttf font format<br>
      - Started updating this changelog page so I don't regret not doing it in the future<br>
      - Made the text and images in the text box unselectable cuz why does it need to be<br>
      - Added three new faces to my character sprites ("Woo!", "Enraged", and "Sleep")<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • (The latter of which looks kinda stupid so I might ask someone to help me fix it)<br>
      - Fixed the text alignment on all the pages to be accurate (and made this page's text box width larger)<br>
      - Made the school site into what I'll call "Manual Mode" where I'll update it manually until I fix the javascript
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Saturday, Feb 12, 2022</u><br>
      - Worked on getting a better custom DEP font for the past 3 days and finally got it exported<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • Went through 6 betas until it comfortably stayed at v1.06<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • Tweaks just consisted of height changes for a few characters so they could align better<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • Huge thanks to Caylie for providing resources to help me get this font from idea to reality<br>
      - Added the custom font to the site, and now it is what's currently being used :)<br>
      - Planning on simplifying the edges and releasing that as v2.06 in the very near future<br>
      - On a less bright note, irl controversy made me feel like killing myself so I made a sort of suicide note and made most of the pages redirect to it<br>
      - Also tweaked the text boxes again
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Wednesday, Feb 9, 2022</u><br>
      - Tried making the school js better but ended up breaking it<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • I also added an "is it broken" status at the top<br>
      - That's literally it lmao
    </article>
    <article>
      <u>Tuesday, Feb 8, 2022</u><br>
      - Fixed text box formatting to be working as intended<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • It now stays as one size even as the window gets rescaled, and fits the screen snugly on mobile<br>
      - Added a sitelist as a concentrated place to navigate my webpages.<br>
      - Added a planned changes page to act as a documentation for what I want to do with this site. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; • It also acted as a place to publicly thank Mathew for his immense help while creating and updating this site<br>
      - Updated the main page accordingly<br>
      - Uncancerfied the am I at school js so it was easier to read and modify

      Site created. Currently using it to test actual published web development for a big project.<br>
