      Hey! Spax here.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="joyful">
      I did a LOT this year.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      Good and bad, thoughtful and stupid, cool and boring, all that stuff.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="expressionless">
      Last year I wanted to do a retrospective for 2023 on cohost, but I never ended up doing it, so I made a promise to myself to do it this year.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="pensive">
      (But not on cohost because it's dead in a couple hours. RIP cohost)
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      So, no better place to start than an immediate major blunder!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      In late December (of 2023), an irl friend of mine wanted css help for their incremental browser game, so I volunteered and made a better stylesheet for it.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="nervous">
      I ended up getting carried away with modifying it and rewrote basically all of the javascript. My friend did not like this and refused to merge the changes I made, and this was the start of a semi-long feud between me and her.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="expressionless">
      I kept maintaining my fork of her repository (even after her original repository went private). This was until around the middle of March when I finally realized that it's a better idea to maintain a good relationship with her rather than be elitist about code I wrote but still effectively stole from her.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      I archived the repository and made a formal apology to her, and our relationship has basically fully recovered since. I still regret basically everything I did, save for one thing:
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      Over the course of the 3 months this went on, I had learned a fuck-ton of javascript, html, css, git, bash, game making/maintaining, et cetera. I learned a lot more than I had in previous years with the web dev in particular, so I figured I should work on my site again!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="happy">
      Speaking of which, let's jump back to February.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="bashful">
      After getting a lot of opinions, I decided to buy spax.zone and move everything from spiritaxolotl.github.io to it.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      The filepaths still weren't pretty, but it was nicer to, first: have a site that was actually owned by me, and second: have a shorter domain name.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="bashful">
      Regardless, it was nice to have! I even changed my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spax.zone">Bluesky</a> to the domain.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      The other domains I was considering getting were spax.dev, spax.space, spax.blue, spax.ooo, and more recently spax.fish. Maybe in the future I'll get them.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="bashful">
      spax.zone felt nice though. Huge thanks to <a href="https://oat.zone/">oatmealine</a> for fully convincing me to get a .zone domain and be top-level domain neighbors!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      Oh yea, yugoslavia.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      If you know me well, you know about one of my favorite websites Ever: <a href="https://yugoslavia.best/">yugoslavia.best</a>.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      It's worth noting that I was pretty good friends with the owner of the site, <a href="https://mayf.pink/">mayflower</a>. yugoslavia.best had a discord server that I was a part of and was pretty active in.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="expressionless">
      When that whole browser game feud happened, mayflower and the other admins caught wind of the situation and banned me from the server after I refused to stop. It was 100% deserved.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="joyful">
      But now I can say that I was banned from yugoslavia!, which I think is very funny.
    </article>
    <!--<article who="nahua" emotion="happy">
      Mayflower *is* willing to unban me soon because I repaired my relationship with my friend and haven't exhibited Dumbass Behavior for a while, so that's nice because I did really enjoy that server.
    </article>
    -->
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      I suppose I should talk about less about negative things. Since we're still in February/March, I'll rapid-fire a few notable things that don't warrant an entire rant about:
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="happy">
      I started listening to Aphex Twin! Really good artist with weird experimental music. I don't really know how to explain it, but it is definitely Autism music, and not everyone will vibe with it.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      I really like <a href="https://youtu.be/gTBirmyzUbU">in a room7 F760</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/5cswwkz8sAQ">Acrid Avid Jam Shred</a> in particular, but there's so many other ones that are so good. Remind me later to make a playlist of my favorite Aphex Twin songs.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="joyful">
      I also created <a href="/tests/horse/">The Horse Buttonâ„¢</a>, one of the funniest web apps I've ever made. You click the button and it'll take you to a random .horse site!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      I used to have a text document of all the valid domains, but it's hard to update on my own, so I decided to just scrape <a href="https://every.horse/">every.horse</a> which is a semi-automatically updated list that I can reliably use.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="nervous">
      Sorry Ryan!!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="joyful">
      I also met some really nice people from the <a href="https://projectoutfox.com/">Project OutFox</a> Discord server!!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      Shoutout to mio, jules, and maddy. Y'all are so cool and I'm so glad I met you three!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      Oh, and I asked my friend <a href="https://marbelynrye.a0001.net/">marbelyn</a> to make a better system for displaying my little dialogue boxes on my site, so she went to work and came up with the use of &lt;article&gt; tags and custom attributes ("who" and "emotion") to have the images defined in the css rather than the html, and holy shit it is so much cleaner.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      I've tinkered with it since then, but the html structure remains mostly unchanged. Thank you so much marbelyn!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      Oh, this is a January thing, but I played <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/UndertaleYellow/136925">Undertale Yellow</a>.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      Genuinely such a good Undertale fangame. Extremely faithful to the original without too many flaws. Great music, great art, great mechanics, and great extension of the lore. I highly recommend playing it if you've played Undertale.

      Okay it is approaching midnight REALLY fast so I need to speed this stream-of-thought blogpost haha.
    </article>
    -->
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      Okay, let's move into April. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/SpiritAxolotl/Notitg-Winestealth-Patch">patch to NotITG</a> that fixes one of the modifiers to work on MacOS and Linux. I turned 18 (finally) and travelled to London. Met up with the lead devs of Project Outfox and drank beer with them. I also played Rain World for the first time but not for very long.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="nervous">
      Now let's hop back to late December 2023 again. I had failed not one, not two, but FOUR classes in my second quarter in senior year of high school, THREE of which were required classes.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="expressionless">
      Jumping back to late April, with basically one month before graduation, I REALLY NEEDED TO GET MY SHIT TOGETHER.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="disappointed">
      I went cold-turkey off of Discord while I took two of the three (required) failed classes online, and retaking the other one with my very willing teacher (who I'm so thankful to).
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      As an accidental replacement for Discord, I ended up using cohost a lot more than before, becoming extremely active and learning even more about html and css.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      A lot of my time I should have spent locking in on my schoolwork, I spent on cohost instead, but it actually kept me sane through all of it. The schoolwork sucked ass.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="joyful">
      I ended up writing a userscript to help automate parts of my online classes. Thank god I did that or else I would have actually had to learn the material!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      I should do a dedicated blogpost about the entire month of May. So much happened during it regarding my schoolwork and cohost.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      Something too good to skip though is <a href="/tests/animal-gender-bodypart/">animal gender bodypart</a>: a silly website I made based on a cohost post I saw that poked fun at the tumblr usernames leaking into cohost, consisting of an animal, some sort of gendered term, and a common body part. I got a friend to style it nicely and now it's a fun thing to go to every so often.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="bashful">
      Anyways, I figured everything out and was able to pass all my classes in time for graduation, so now I can finally say I've graduated high school! College is next up.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      So now, it's June. I've graduated, and I decided to buy a <a href="https://dropout.tv/">dropout.tv</a> subscription so I can watch some of their really good shows like Game Changer and Very Important People.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      I also went on a two-week-long trip to South Africa in the middle of June to the beginning of July. It was really fun!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="happy">
      On my way back from the trip, we had a connection with New York City, so I rang up my friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bizzlemip.page">bizzlemip</a> and we met at that one famous chinatown arcade. It was really fun meeting biz and her friend irl!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="joyful">
      So in the middle of July, I finally got my driver's license! It was nice to have a bit of extra freedom with it.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      Unfortunately, my grandfather died right after I got it. We travelled to his state to attend his funeral, and then Cloudstrike happened and we were stuck in there for an extra few days haha. Very interesting experience.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      Around this time, I met someone on cohost who got me out of my shell a bit with nsfw. I ended up breaking up with them a few months later due to our very different personalities, but it was a really nice couple of months when we were together.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="joyful">
      It was ALSO around this time that I finally convinced my irl friend and primary artist to finally draw me a <a href="/html/nahua-ref-sheet.html">reference sheet for Nahua</a>! I made a website to better communicate some extra details, as well as to have a permanent link to the most updated reference sheet.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="nervous">
      Okay, time to get back to the unavoidable controversial stuff.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="expressionless">
      August 10th, I had made a series of bad decisions that caused my account to get banned on cohost for block evasion. The entire situation is mostly just embarrassing and me being a dumbass rather than being malicious and hateful, boiling down to me misunderstanding a post, commenting under it, getting blocked and having a screenshot of my comment posted, and trying to explain my ass under another account. Not flattering, not fun. RIP my cohost account, and RIP cohost who announced its imminent shutdown almost month later. You can go see my now-deleted account in <a href="cohost.org/Spax">web archives</a>.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      Anyways, with a lot more html and css under my belt, I finally decided to start working on spax.zone again. I moved my host from GitHub over to Cloudflare (which is SUPER nice), migrated the css to scss, made a better index page, added build instructions to run node.js scripts and move files around, set up redirects, and a lot more.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="bashful">
      I had also met someone on Discord who had a mutual friend I hadn't talked to in years, so I reconnected with that mutual and we now talk pretty often again! They eventually gifted me quite a few games when I was in a bit of a financial pinch. Huge shoutout to Rose. Such a real one.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      In the next month, I played Pseudoregalia, Inscryption, Outer Wilds, and more Rain World. Such good games, especially Outer Wilds.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="joyful">
      Then in late September, I finally decided to actually try get a job so that I at least had MONEY. I ended up getting hired at Spirit Halloween for the entire month of October, and it was genuinely a blast, not to mention that I FINALLY HAD MONEY!! I spent so much money on furry art in the coming months haha.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      Oh, we're jumping back to August. I also decided to work on a more automated approach to dumping the dialogue of Temmie's game <a href="https://tuyoki.itch.io/dwellers-empty-path">Dweller's Empty Path</a>, and with a bit of reverse engineering and pattern recognition, <a href="/html/DEPalldialogue.html">I was finally able to make a pretty good site out of it</a>! I also made a browser port but I need to iron out one stupid thing about it before I feel comfortable linking it here haha.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      Now let's jump forward to SEPTEMBER. Yes this blogpost is everywhere, sorry.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="nervous">
      I got banned from the NotITG server due to pent-up anger about the community not being very welcoming to me and not really liking the demeanors of most of the admins, so after almost a year of being muted, I finally responded to the admins with a long ass text post that just made them say "actually we don't want you in the community anymore, you are getting banned now" and I was like "yea honestly fair enough sorry". Sorry Taro!!
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      Now jumping back to early November. I went on a trip to Cuba with my other (still alive) grandfather, and went through the hurricane that passed through Havana haha. We got back like a week later with Trump elected as U.S. president (FUCK) and barely missing an EARTHQUAKE in Cuba. Christ. OH and I also played a lot of Balatro mobile because Cuba doesn't have cell service so I needed something to play offline.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="happy">
      I also forgot to mention for the past 2 months I had been studying for the SAT which is actually a lie because I only crammed the homework stuff for the course I was taking in the last week before the actual test, but the test went well! I got a 1430 so now getting into some colleges will be a bit easier.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      I became an hbomberguy patron too! His Discord server is so fun to talk in.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="look">
      The most notable thing that happened this year I think was my very sudden <a href="/html/gender.html">gender crisis</a> at the end of November, where I discovered so much about myself in such a short amount of time. I love gender so much.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      And that brings us to about December! I made my 1000th commit on the spax.zone repository and started commissioning more experimental art and making my own fursona (yea, Nahua is NOT my fursona fun fact). I've also been dipping my toes into Balatro modding.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="dizzy">
      Anyways, christ what a stream-of-thought blogpost.
    </article>
    <article who="nahua" emotion="neutral">
      Thank you so much for reading it! I'll probably go back and edit it so it's more concise in the future but I really want to get this out before January 1st 2025 in my timezone.
