# Real description
Okay time to make an actual website description here. So I started making this site to test html for another project that I'm working on, but I got a little carried away with the design of the site and now I'm trying to make it as close as possible to the Dweller's Empty Path look. This included painstaking css, creating an entire .ttf font, and now javascript, somehow. 

But there's no way that I could have done this entire site alone. Here are the people who helped out the most:

## Mathew
Mathew was an ENORMOUS help when I first made this site. He helped me fix some of the bugs and taught me some of the css I didn't know (as well as some html formatting). His sense of humor was enjoyable and made the programming process feel less robotic, and his sheer will to try find the fixes to my obscure code was beyond useful, and overall, Mathew gave me even more of a passion to work on the site. If it wasn't for him, I probably would have scrapped this site pretty early on and I cannot thank him enough for all he's done. (He also gets all flustered when I give him public crediting so I wrote a hecc-ton of stuff about him here hehehehe)

## CalmBubbles
Oh boy where do I even start. I had known Calm since the start of 2021 beause he subscribed to my youtube and joined my ~~(dead)~~ discord server, but when he started suggesting fixes to my website, he already showed himself to be a valuable resource, and I quickly invited him to the now-three-person team for the website. His incredibly useful fixes included setting the text box character images to have no interpolation (hence staying pixelated), keeping the starry background from not rendering under short amounts of text boxes, and making an image that was supposed to be on embeds show up on embeds again. He also could add things to the site when I wasn't able to in the moment that I needed them in. But for the cherry on top, on my birthday, Calm made [this site](https://spiritaxolotl.github.io/html/spaxDay) for my birthday, which was basically a demo of animated text boxes with progressive generated text. It was hilarious, impressive, and so many other things when he first gifted it to me. I soon looked into his code afterwards and saw that he used javascript and made an entirely new dialogue system, which to this day I still cannot believe he did all that in general, but also that he did it for my *birthday*. I give Calm so many thanks for the massive improvements and innovations for this silly little site. 

## Other Mentions
Here are some other people who helped fix minor things on the site:

- Sudospective
- oatmealine
- norom

## Final Thoughts
Hats off to EVERYONE who helped me in the making of this site. Like I said before, this site started off as a test for another project I was going to start working on, but has now become both a passion project of mine, and a collaboration between many people who have all helped out in their own ways. I still cannot believe how amazing complete strangers on the internet can be. You guys will continue to inspire me every day. 

Thank you,<br>
