## 2024 Update
Hey! Welcome to my website! Some things are gonna be changing here soon, but I want to give a bit more context to everything.  
I started working on this in sophomore year of high school, with the intention of just testing some basic html for another project, but I got a bit carried away with the theme of it. Now, everything is made to mimic the look of Temmie Chang's game [Dweller's Empty Path](https://tuyoki.itch.io/dwellers-empty-path) (which I now realize was aimed to look like a gameboy game).  
At the time of making the site, I had learned some basic html and css in a class I took from the previous semester, and was still learning how to program in javascript from yet another class (which was apparently version 1.0?? and not even in a webdev environment. awful). Because of this, my old pages reflect my limited knowledge at the time. I wrote all of my html from scratch, without the use of a framework, and minimal use of javascript. Hell, most of the time I was only seeing my changes *after* my site was deployed.  
A few months after deploying the site, a friend of mine named [CalmBubbles](https://github.com/CalmBubbles) decided to contribute. He worked on quite a bit of javascript to make my site easier to scale (and even made a few birthday gifts for me).  
Now that I've been programming for a few years, both academically and personal, I've learned way better ways to do the things I originally tried to do, and what Calm had already done.  
In the coming months, I'm planning on refactoring my old site with Svelte and using github actions, so that everything gets built to html rather than having javascript run to show the contents of an otherwise static page, and so the text boxes don't have to be a copypasted mess of divs. I want to do this as the final farewell to my old code. Alongside that, I want to work on a better showcase of things I've done and make an actual portfolio. After both of those are done, everything in the html folder will probably move to a new "old" directory on the site (or maybe even its own subdomain). This readme will also be rewritten.  

I want to thank everyone who either directly or indirectly helped me make my website.  
In no particular order:
- Mathew
- CalmBubbles
- 1LikeBananas
- HeySora
- Sudospective
- oatmealine
- niko
- marbelynrye
- lostdusty
- jj
- norom
- amber (somehow)

And thank *you* for reading.

> ## Real description
> Okay time to make an actual website description here. So I started making this site to test html for another project
> that I'm working on, but I got a little carried away with the design of the site and now I'm trying to make it as close
> as possible to the [Dweller's Empty Path](https://tuyoki.itch.io/dwellers-empty-path) look. This included painstaking css,
> creating an entire .ttf font, and now javascript, somehow.
>
> But there's no way that I could have done this entire site alone. Here are the people who helped out the most:
>
> ### [Mathew](https://github.com/mathew27700)
> Mathew was an ENORMOUS help when I first made this site. He helped me fix some of the bugs and taught me some of
> the css I didn't know (as well as some html formatting). His sense of humor was enjoyable and made the programming
> process feel less robotic, and his sheer will to try find the fixes to my obscure code was beyond useful, and overall,
> Mathew gave me even more of a passion to work on the site. If it wasn't for him, I probably would have scrapped
> this site pretty early on and I cannot thank him enough for all he's done. (He also gets all flustered when I give
> him public crediting so I wrote a fuck-ton of stuff about him here hehehehe.)
>
> ### [CalmBubbles](https://github.com/CalmBubbles)
> Jeez, where do I even start. I had known Calm since the start of 2021 beause he subscribed to my youtube and joined
> my ~~(dead)~~ discord server, but when he started suggesting fixes to my website, he already showed himself to be a
> valuable resource, and I quickly invited him to the now-three-person team for the website. His incredibly useful fixes
> included setting the text box character images to have no interpolation (hence staying pixelated), keeping the starry
> background from not rendering under short amounts of text boxes, and making an image that was supposed to be on embeds
> show up on embeds again. He also could add things to the site when I wasn't able to in the moment that I needed them in.
> But for the cherry on top, on my birthday, Calm made [this site](https://spiritaxolotl.github.io/html/spaxDay) for my
> birthday, which was basically a demo of animated text boxes with progressively displayed text. It was hilarious,
> impressive, and so many other things when he first gifted it to me. I soon looked into his code afterwards and saw that he
> used javascript and made an entirely new dialogue system, which to this day I still cannot believe he did all that in
> general, but also that he did it for my *birthday*. I give Calm so many thanks for the massive improvements and
> innovations for this silly little site.
>
> ### Other Mentions
> Here are some other people who helped fix miscellaneous minor things on the site:
> - [HeySora](https://www.heysora.net)
> - [Sudospective](https://sudospective.net)
> - [oatmealine](https://oat.zone)
> - [norom](https://twitter.com/_norom_)
>
> ### Final Thoughts
> Thank you to EVERYONE who helped me in the making of this site. Like I said before, this site started off as a test for
> another project I was going to start working on, but has now become both a passion project of mine, and a collaboration
> between many people who have all helped out in their own ways. I still cannot believe how amazing complete strangers on
> the internet can be. You guys will continue to inspire me every day.
